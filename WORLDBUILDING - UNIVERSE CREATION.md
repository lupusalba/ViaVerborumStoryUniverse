# WORLD BIBLE — Human Playground (v0.1)
Status: Draft (canon-in-progress)

## Truth Layers (use everywhere)
- **CANON:** always true in-story
- **COMMON BELIEF:** what most people think is true (can be wrong)
- **AUTHOR SECRET:** never revealed on-page (but drives causality)
- **OPEN SLOT:** intentionally undecided (future hook)

---

# 1) One-Page Overview
## 1.1 Core premise (1–3 sentences)
- [OPEN SLOT]

## 1.2 The Big Split
### CANON
- The universe is split into **Inner Region** and **Outer Region**.

### STORY LEVERS
- Inner vs Outer creates: exploration, colonization, ideology clash, tech vs mana warfare, evolution pressure.

---

# 2) Cosmology & Map
## 2.1 Inner Region (the “old” universe)
### CANON
- Abundant in mana; mana is omnipresent on most celestial bodies.
- Life evolved with mana.
- Abundant in all resources.
- Oldest part of the universe.
- Home to first life (and oldest species).
- Divided between **3 old mega-empires**:
  - Magic Empire
  - Empire of Beasts
  - Empire of Shadows
- Minor empires and forces exist; nearly all are vassals to one of the 3 old empires.

### OPEN SLOT
- Exact geography (galaxy map, border thickness, distances, navigational hazards).

## 2.2 Outer Region (the “dead” universe)
### CANON
- Circular region around the Inner Region.
- Divided from the Inner Region by vast emptiness and an asteroid belt from both sides.
- Assumed by Inner Region residents to be dead (no life).
- Scarce resources.
- Few explorations were tried; no success and not profitable.
- **NO MANA.**
- Hidden in one part (closest to the border of the Magic Empire) is **human territory**.

### OPEN SLOT
- Why “no mana” exists here (physics/cosmology rule).
- Why exploration fails (navigation, economics, hazards).

## 2.3 Inter-Region Boundary & Travel Rules
### OPEN SLOT (must be defined to prevent plot holes)
### CANON — The Boundary is a Real Barrier, Not Distance
- The Inner and Outer regions are separated by a **Vast Emptiness** plus an **Asteroid Belt from both sides**
- There are no celestial bodies in the barrier, so gravity drive can not work.
- **There is no mana in the barrier**
- Random spatial rifts with random size and in the  random location appear throughout barrier.
	- Spatial rift is a shimmering, barely visible, unnatural tear in reality, a portal bleeding colors unseen, often crackling with raw energy, connecting worlds, timelines, or dimensions, looking like shattered glass or liquid void, with effects from teleportation to catastrophic reality-warping, releasing otherworldly entities or sucking victims into oblivion.
-  few tries were attempted by 3 big empires, but spoils of expedition are not profitable at all, and there is nearly nothing that anyone from inner universe would need from outer universe
- Outer region has no mana, mana dependent technology is too expensive for use
- Human territory exist 

- What happens to mana systems near the boundary?
	- There is no ambient mana at all from border of inner region.
	- They do not work on ambient mana - they need to use mana stored in mana pools and aura cores of living beings, and mana crystals for powering of machines and space ships
- What happens to human tech sensors/propulsion near the boundary?
	- Everything works as normal
	- fuel requirements are immense for one way trip from Human territory to outer border of inner universe
	- There are no celestial bodies so use of gravity drive is impossible

### COMMON BELIEFS
 - Inner belief: “Outer is dead; only rocks; no mana; no useful resources.”
 - Human belief: "This is barrier, we must find out what is behind it"
 - Humans do not know about existence of mana

# 3) Major Factions — Inner Region Mega-Empires
## 3.1 Magic Empire
### 3.1.1 Identity & Scope
#### CANON
- Ruled by “magic species”:
  - **Elves & Dark Elves** as nobility and rulers
  - **Orcs & other species** as commoners
- Technology is based on magic.
- The empire has many galaxies and vassals under it.
- Direct territories are ruled by governors (usually **6th-circle mages**).

### 3.1.2 Lifespans (baseline + progression)
#### CANON
- Elves: 300 to 600 years baseline.
- Orcs: ~150 years baseline.
- If success as **knights** or **mages**, lifespan is extended.
- Knight path lifespan extension: ~10% to 200% (general estimate).
- Mage path lifespan extension: ~30% to 500% (general estimate).

### 3.1.3 Military Overview
#### CANON
- Main fighting forces:
  - Mages
  - Knights

---

## 3.1.4 The Mage System (Circles)
### CANON — Requirements
- A mage is born with a **mana pool** (required to become a mage).
- Mage cast spells with mana from mana pool, and using that mana as a trigger and guide, they influence ambient mana

### CANON — Progression
- Power levels: **1st to 9th circle**
- Leveling up by constructing an **inner magic circle** around the mana pool.
- Most common levels are **3rd circle**.
- Each level extends natural lifespan.

### CANON — Knowledge Control
- Blueprints for circles **1, 2, 3** are public knowledge.
- Blueprints of circles **6 and up** are restricted by the **Royal Tower of Magic**.
- Inner magic circles are a technique developed by mage scholars of the **Royal Tower of Magic**.
- Some mage scholars tried developing higher circles from public blueprints; succeeded with varying degrees, but results are worse than Magic Tower circles.

### CANON — Advancement Barriers
- Talent is needed (high mana affinity, sensitivity, absorption).
- Not everyone has it, but most nobility does.
- Major hurdles: between **3→4**, **6→7**, **7→8**, **8→9**.
- Most nobility is stuck at **6th circle** (talent cap).
- More talented nobles can reach higher circles:
  - 3 ducal houses produce **7th circle** mages nearly every generation.
  - **8th circle** likely reached by old ancestors in hibernation (as house trump cards).

### CANON — High-End Power Holders
- Two known **9th circle** mages:
  - Current emperor
  - Head of the Royal Magic Tower
- Very probable there are more **9th circle** mages in hibernation, and many **8th circle** mages as well.

### CANON — Improvisation Risk
- Mages can risk improvising circle creation without blueprints; very risky.

### CANON — Circle Quality Effects
- Quality impacts:
  - Stability of magic
  - Speed of casting
  - Increase of mana pool capacity (circles compress mana and strengthen shell of mana pool)

### CANON — Institutions
- **Royal Tower of Magic**
  - Governs the Magic Academy (main educational institution)
  - Divisions:
    - Combat
    - Research
    - Artifact crafting
- **Royal Magic Academy**
  - Nobility can get education if talented

### CANON — Mana Use
- Mana absorbed via meditation (absorption + refinement).
- Magic circles support mana gathering and refinement (closer to mage affinity).
- Mages have mana affinity to special mana types (fire, water, earth, wind, light, darkness, others).
- Affinity:
  - lowers mana consumption for that element (more efficient)
  - makes it easier to absorb/refine that mana type

### OPEN SLOT
- Mage laws, taboo spells, enforcement arm, internal politics of Tower vs nobles.

---

## 3.1.5 The Knight System
### CANON — Requirements & Accessibility
- Knights need less talent than mages to achieve success:
  - Do not need a mana pool
  - Need only mana sensitivity and absorption ability
- Vast majority of Magic Empire population are knights.
- Orc tribe is generally composed of knights.

### CANON — Progression Ladder
- Levels:
  - Low
  - Mid
  - High-level knight
  - Master
  - Grandmaster

### CANON — Lifespan & Body Changes
- Minor lifespan increase after each breakthrough.
- After becoming **Master**:
  - Lifespan is doubled
- After becoming **Grandmaster**:
  - Lifespan is doubled again
  - Age reversal is possible (make body younger again)
  - Body reconstruction is possible (younger and more optimal for mana as a knight)

### CANON — Cultivation Mechanics
- Mana absorbed via techniques (meditation).
- Body refined using mana and other resources.
- Knights must:
  - Strengthen bones, muscles, inner organs
  - Open mana pathways in the body
  - Form a mana core (lesser version of a mana pool)
- Knights can absorb mana of any type.
- Lesser requirement in mana purity (less time refining).
- Knights can have a “mana tribute/attribute”:
  - higher affinity to special mana
  - ability to use techniques similar to primitive magic

### CANON — Knowledge & Schools
- Public knowledge how to become a knight, but methods differ.
- Some methods have much better effect than public techniques:
  - nobility methods
  - knight families
  - Royal Knight Academy
  - special knight schools
  - strongest knights’ methods
- Highest educational institution is **Royal Knight Academy**.
- Knights are the majority in the empire military.

### OPEN SLOT
- Knight orders, duels, oaths, implants/artifacts, battlefield doctrine vs mages.

---

## 3.2 Empire of Beasts
### CANON (current)
- Magic beasts (dragons and similar).
- Extremely high individual power.
- Born with high power level.
- "The Empire" is in name only, It's a **dominion web** of apex territories enforced by overwhelmingly powerful individuals.

### GOAL (what they want)
- To not be interrupted
- They do not desire conquest or outside expanison
- At slightest provocation or intrusion on their territory (by other empires), they strike with full force (or send strongest fighter) and destroy the intruder.

### METHOD (how they project power)
- **Apex deterrence:** a few top entities enforce borders.
- **Tribute ecology:** no tribute
### CONSTRAINT (what stops them)
- **Low density / slow reproduction:** they can’t flood space with numbers.
- **Territory dependence:** peak power requires living in mana-rich nodes (they weaken if forced into “thin mana” regions for long).
- **Coordination ceiling:** apex egos cause internal conflict; alliances are temporary.

### WEAKNESS (how they can lose)
- Logistics + traps:
  - engineered kill-zones
  - swarm tactics that deny “single target dominance”

### STANCE ON HUMANS (set for later stories)
- **Default:** “irrelevant” (mana-blind, outer-dead sector).
- **If contact occurs:** split response:
  - Some see humans as prey.
  - Some see humans as *dangerous tool-makers* who can mass-produce counters.

### INTERNAL FACTIONS (simple, high-utility)
- grouped by species (dragon, phoenix, )
- grouped by status (noble or not)
- noble species are dragons and phoenixes
### OPEN SLOT (needed later)
- Governance structure, territory model, reproduction rules, economy, diplomacy, “laws of the strong,” etc.

---

## 3.3 Empire of Shadows
### CANON (current)
- Mysterious.
- Small numbers.
- Power equal to other empires.

### OPEN SLOT (needed later)
- What they are, how they reproduce, what they want, why they’re few, their “signature power.”

---

# 4) Outer Region Civilization — Humans
## 4.1 Origins & Expansion
### CANON
- Humans developed in the dead part of the universe (short time on universe scale).
- After many bloody wars, humans united under one government and began serious space exploration.
- Humans mastered:
  - Space colonization
  - Terraforming
  - Upgraded space travel
  - Colonized dozens of celestial bodies
- Population close to a half trillion.
- Humans still fight each other, but it is strictly regulated.

## 4.2 Governance
### CANON
- Governed by the **Earth Council**.
  - HQ on Earth (“origin of human race”).
  - Earth Council is governed by the **Elder Council**.
  - Human territory is divided in 12 domains with names of Zodiac

## 4.3 Human Tech Direction
### CANON
- Humans always first invest and improve military.
- Humans have nearly speed-of-light travel ability and vast resources.
- Notes on resource mismatch:
  - Resources humans need to travel through the whole galaxy are available in Inner universe much easier.
  - Resources precious to humans are nearly useless to Inner universe (technology diverged).
- Humans mastered science and are defining rules of the universe, using power of the universe:
  - Gravity drive (using gravity of celestial bodies to speed up)
  - Dyson sphere harvesting energy (and more to be added)

## 4.4 Humans & Mana (public reality)
### CANON
- Humans have a weak shell of mana pool.
- Nearly all humans have a mana pool (potential for magic).
- All humans have potential to be knights.
- Humans were not exposed to mana.
- Humans are at stage **0.2** of evolution; they need exposure to mana to evolve.
  - Uncontrolled exposure: >98% chance the human dies.
  - Humans need systematic evolution (humans are capable of it).
  - Humans can safely evolve in controlled conditions with the right approach.
  - Time estimate:
    - For one human: 10 years at most
    - For talented ones: 5 years
- Humans do not know about the existence of mana or its effects.

## 4.5 Humans & the Inner Region
### CANON
- Human territory is hidden in one part of the Outer Region, closest to the Magic Empire border.
- Inner Region residents assume the Outer Region is dead.

### OPEN SLOT
- First contact triggers, border incidents, espionage, “why hidden,” detection failures.

# 5) AUTHOR SECRET FILES (never revealed on-page)
## 5.1 GRAND SECRET, FORGOTTEN HISTORY
### AUTHOR SECRET (current)
- This is not to be revealed at any point (author-only worldbuilding).
- Humans are not born on deathworld Earth.
- Humans ran away to the Outer universe to hide and survive.
- Humans are the most stubborn lifeform in the universe; they refuse extinction.
- Humans are the most bloody and power-hungry race, with high intelligence.
- Humans are more prone to war than orcs.
- Humans and the Inner universe do not know about the GRAND SECRET.
- Humans assume they were born on Earth.

### OPEN SLOT (optional but useful)
- The pursuer (who/what forced the escape), the original home, the “scar” left behind, the hidden evidence.

---

# 6) Power System — Mana
## 6.1 Mana as an evolutionary force
### CANON (current)
- Mana is one of the main forces of evolution:
  - It evolved all species in the Inner universe; those who could not evolve died.
- At the beginning of the Inner universe, as life was born, it was tested by mana.
  - First species were **monsters** (not beasts):
    - Beasts have intelligence
    - Monsters do not
  - Until they evolved to accept mana, they were monsters.

### OPEN SLOT (needs definition for consistency)
- Mana physics: source, movement, depletion, storage.
- Interaction rules: what mana does to biology/technology.
- Taxonomy: monster vs beast vs sapient species (edge cases).
- Anti-mana / null zones (if any).
