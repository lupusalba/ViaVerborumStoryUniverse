# WORLD BIBLE — Human Playground (v0.1)
Status: Draft (canon-in-progress)

## Truth Layers (use everywhere)
- **CANON:** always true in-story
- **COMMON BELIEF:** what most people think is true (can be wrong)
- **AUTHOR SECRET:** never revealed on-page (but drives causality)
- **OPEN SLOT:** intentionally undecided (future hook)

---

# 1) One-Page Overview
## 1.1 Core premise (1–3 sentences)
- [OPEN SLOT]

## 1.2 The Big Split
### CANON
- The universe is split into **Inner Region** and **Outer Region**.

### STORY LEVERS
- Inner vs Outer creates: exploration, colonization, ideology clash, tech vs mana warfare, evolution pressure.

---

# 2) Cosmology & Map
## 2.1 Inner Region (the “old” universe)
### CANON
- Abundant in mana; mana is omnipresent on most celestial bodies.
- Life evolved with mana.
- Abundant in all resources.
- Oldest part of the universe.
- Home to first life (and oldest species).
- Divided between **3 old mega-empires**:
  - Magic Empire
  - Empire of Beasts
  - Empire of Shadows
- Minor empires and forces exist; nearly all are vassals to one of the 3 old empires.

### OPEN SLOT
- Exact geography (galaxy map, border thickness, distances, navigational hazards).

## 2.2 Outer Region (the “dead” universe)
### CANON
- Circular region around the Inner Region.
- Divided from the Inner Region by vast emptiness and an asteroid belt from both sides.
- Assumed by Inner Region residents to be dead (no life).
- Scarce resources.
- Few explorations were tried; no success and not profitable.
- **NO MANA.**
- Hidden in one part (closest to the border of the Magic Empire) is **human territory**.

### OPEN SLOT
- Why “no mana” exists here (physics/cosmology rule).
- Why exploration fails (navigation, economics, hazards).

## 2.3 Inter-Region Boundary & Travel Rules
### OPEN SLOT (must be defined to prevent plot holes)
### CANON — The Boundary is a Real Barrier, Not Distance
- The Inner and Outer regions are separated by a **Vast Emptiness** plus an **Asteroid Belt from both sides**
- There are no celestial bodies in the barrier, so gravity drive can not work.
- **There is no mana in the barrier**
- Random spatial rifts with random size and in the  random location appear throughout barrier.
	- Spatial rift is a shimmering, barely visible, unnatural tear in reality, a portal bleeding colors unseen, often crackling with raw energy, connecting worlds, timelines, or dimensions, looking like shattered glass or liquid void, with effects from teleportation to catastrophic reality-warping, releasing otherworldly entities or sucking victims into oblivion.
-  few tries were attempted by 3 big empires, but spoils of expedition are not profitable at all, and there is nearly nothing that anyone from inner universe would need from outer universe
- Outer region has no mana, mana dependent technology is too expensive for use
- Human territory exist 

- What happens to mana systems near the boundary?
	- There is no ambient mana at all from border of inner region.
	- They do not work on ambient mana - they need to use mana stored in mana pools and aura cores of living beings, and mana crystals for powering of machines and space ships
- What happens to human tech sensors/propulsion near the boundary?
	- Everything works as normal
	- fuel requirements are immense for one way trip from Human territory to outer border of inner universe
	- There are no celestial bodies so use of gravity drive is impossible

### COMMON BELIEFS
 - Inner belief: “Outer is dead; only rocks; no mana; no useful resources.”
 - Human belief: "This is barrier, we must find out what is behind it"
 - Humans do not know about existence of mana

# 3) Major Factions — Inner Region Mega-Empires
## 3.1 Magic Empire
### 3.1.1 Identity & Scope
#### CANON
- Ruled by “magic species”:
  - **Elves & Dark Elves** as nobility and rulers
  - **Orcs & other species** as commoners
- Technology is based on magic.
- The empire has many galaxies and vassals under it.
- Direct territories are ruled by governors (usually **6th-circle mages**).

### 3.1.2 Lifespans (baseline + progression)
#### CANON
- Elves: 300 to 600 years baseline.
- Orcs: ~150 years baseline.
- If success as **knights** or **mages**, lifespan is extended.
- Knight path lifespan extension: ~10% to 200% (general estimate).
- Mage path lifespan extension: ~30% to 500% (general estimate).

### 3.1.3 Military Overview
#### CANON
- Main fighting forces:
  - Mages
  - Knights

---

## 3.1.4 The Mage System (Circles)
### CANON — Requirements
- A mage is born with a **mana pool** (required to become a mage).
- Mage cast spells with mana from mana pool, and using that mana as a trigger and guide, they influence ambient mana

### CANON — Progression
- Power levels: **1st to 9th circle**
- Leveling up by constructing an **inner magic circle** around the mana pool.
- Most common levels are **3rd circle**.
- Each level extends natural lifespan.

### CANON — Knowledge Control
- Blueprints for circles **1, 2, 3** are public knowledge.
- Blueprints of circles **6 and up** are restricted by the **Royal Tower of Magic**.
- Inner magic circles are a technique developed by mage scholars of the **Royal Tower of Magic**.
- Some mage scholars tried developing higher circles from public blueprints; succeeded with varying degrees, but results are worse than Magic Tower circles.

### CANON — Advancement Barriers
- Talent is needed (high mana affinity, sensitivity, absorption).
- Not everyone has it, but most nobility does.
- Major hurdles: between **3→4**, **6→7**, **7→8**, **8→9**.
- Most nobility is stuck at **6th circle** (talent cap).
- More talented nobles can reach higher circles:
  - 3 ducal houses produce **7th circle** mages nearly every generation.
  - **8th circle** likely reached by old ancestors in hibernation (as house trump cards).

### CANON — High-End Power Holders
- Two known **9th circle** mages:
  - Current emperor
  - Head of the Royal Magic Tower
- Very probable there are more **9th circle** mages in hibernation, and many **8th circle** mages as well.

### CANON — Improvisation Risk
- Mages can risk improvising circle creation without blueprints; very risky.

### CANON — Circle Quality Effects
- Quality impacts:
  - Stability of magic
  - Speed of casting
  - Increase of mana pool capacity (circles compress mana and strengthen shell of mana pool)

### CANON — Institutions
- **Royal Tower of Magic**
  - Governs the Magic Academy (main educational institution)
  - Divisions:
    - Combat
    - Research
    - Artifact crafting
- **Royal Magic Academy**
  - Nobility can get education if talented

### CANON — Mana Use
- Mana absorbed via meditation (absorption + refinement).
- Magic circles support mana gathering and refinement (closer to mage affinity).
- Mages have mana affinity to special mana types (fire, water, earth, wind, light, darkness, others).
- Affinity:
  - lowers mana consumption for that element (more efficient)
  - makes it easier to absorb/refine that mana type
- mages can use different devices to aid in spell casting (like wand and staff)
- mages can use magic formations and circles to attract mana (or move it in general)
### OPEN SLOT
- Mage laws, taboo spells, enforcement arm, internal politics of Tower vs nobles.

---

## 3.1.5 The Knight System
### CANON — Requirements & Accessibility
- Knights need less talent than mages to achieve success:
  - Do not need a mana pool
  - Need only mana sensitivity and absorption ability
- Vast majority of Magic Empire population are knights.
- Orc tribe is generally composed of knights.

### CANON — Progression Ladder
- Levels:
  - Low
  - Mid
  - High-level knight
  - Master
  - Grandmaster

### CANON — Lifespan & Body Changes
- Minor lifespan increase after each breakthrough.
- After becoming **Master**:
  - Lifespan is doubled
- After becoming **Grandmaster**:
  - Lifespan is doubled again
  - Age reversal is possible (make body younger again)
  - Body reconstruction is possible (younger and more optimal for mana as a knight)

### CANON — Cultivation Mechanics
- Mana absorbed via techniques (meditation).
- Body refined using mana and other resources.
- Knights must:
  - Strengthen bones, muscles, inner organs
  - Open mana pathways in the body
  - Form a mana core (lesser version of a mana pool)
- Knights can absorb mana of any type.
- Lesser requirement in mana purity (less time refining).
- Knights can have a “mana tribute/attribute”:
  - higher affinity to special mana
  - ability to use techniques similar to primitive magic

### CANON — Knowledge & Schools
- Public knowledge how to become a knight, but methods differ.
- Some methods have much better effect than public techniques:
  - nobility methods
  - knight families
  - Royal Knight Academy
  - special knight schools
  - strongest knights’ methods
- Highest educational institution is **Royal Knight Academy**.
- Knights are the majority in the empire military.

### OPEN SLOT
- Knight orders, duels, oaths, implants/artifacts, battlefield doctrine vs mages.

---

## 3.2 Empire of Beasts
### CANON (current)
- Magic beasts (dragons and similar).
- Extremely high individual power.
- Born with high power level.
- "The Empire" is in name only, It's a **dominion web** of apex territories enforced by overwhelmingly powerful individuals.

### GOAL (what they want)
- To not be interrupted
- They do not desire conquest or outside expanison
- At slightest provocation or intrusion on their territory (by other empires), they strike with full force (or send strongest fighter) and destroy the intruder.

### METHOD (how they project power)
- **Apex deterrence:** a few top entities enforce borders.
- **Tribute ecology:** no tribute
### CONSTRAINT (what stops them)
- **Low density / slow reproduction:** they can’t flood space with numbers.
- **Territory dependence:** peak power requires living in mana-rich nodes (they weaken if forced into “thin mana” regions for long).
- **Coordination ceiling:** apex egos cause internal conflict; alliances are temporary.

### WEAKNESS (how they can lose)
- Logistics + traps:
  - engineered kill-zones
  - swarm tactics that deny “single target dominance”

### STANCE ON HUMANS (set for later stories)
- **Default:** “irrelevant” (mana-blind, outer-dead sector).
- **If contact occurs:** split response:
  - Some see humans as prey.
  - Some see humans as *dangerous tool-makers* who can mass-produce counters.

### INTERNAL FACTIONS (simple, high-utility)
- grouped by species (dragon, phoenix, )
- grouped by status (noble or not)
- noble species are dragons and phoenixes
### OPEN SLOT (needed later)
- Governance structure, territory model, reproduction rules, economy, diplomacy, “laws of the strong,” etc.

---

## 3.3 Empire of Shadows
### CANON (current)
- Mysterious.
- Small numbers.
- Power equal to other empires.

### OPEN SLOT (needed later)
- What they are, how they reproduce, what they want, why they’re few, their “signature power.”

---

# 4) Outer Region Civilization — Humans
## 4.1 Origins & Expansion
### CANON
- Humans developed in the dead part of the universe (short time on universe scale).
- After many bloody wars, humans united under one government and began serious space exploration.
- Humans mastered:
  - Space colonization
  - Terraforming
  - Upgraded space travel
  - Colonized dozens of celestial bodies
- Population close to a half trillion.
- Humans still fight each other, but it is strictly regulated.

## 4.2 Governance
### CANON
- Governed by the **Earth Council**.
  - HQ on Earth (“origin of human race”).
  - Earth Council is governed by the **Elder Council**.
  - Human territory is divided in 12 domains with names of Zodiac

## 4.3 Human Tech Direction
### CANON
- Humans always first invest and improve military.
- Humans have nearly speed-of-light travel ability and vast resources.
- Notes on resource mismatch:
  - Resources humans need to travel through the whole galaxy are available in Inner universe much easier.
  - Resources precious to humans are nearly useless to Inner universe (technology diverged).
- Humans mastered science and are defining rules of the universe, using power of the universe:
  - Gravity drive (using gravity of celestial bodies to speed up)
  - Dyson sphere harvesting energy (and more to be added)

## 4.4 Humans & Mana (public reality)
### CANON
- Humans have a weak shell of mana pool.
- Nearly all humans have a mana pool (potential for magic).
- All humans have potential to be knights.
- Most humans has potential to be both mage and knight (to practice both fields)
- Humans were not exposed to mana.
- Humans are at stage **0.2** of evolution; they need exposure to mana to evolve.
  - Uncontrolled exposure: >98% chance the human dies.
  - Humans need systematic evolution (humans are capable of it).
  - Humans can safely evolve in controlled conditions with the right approach.
  - Time estimate:
    - For one human: 10 years at most
    - For talented ones: 5 years
- Humans do not know about the existence of mana or its effects.
- Humans, on average have medium level talent for magic

## 4.5 Humans & the Inner Region
### CANON
- Human territory is hidden in one part of the Outer Region, closest to the Magic Empire border.
- Inner Region residents assume the Outer Region is dead.

### OPEN SLOT
- First contact triggers, border incidents, espionage, “why hidden,” detection failures.

# 5) AUTHOR SECRET FILES (never revealed on-page)
## 5.1 GRAND SECRET, FORGOTTEN HISTORY
### AUTHOR SECRET (current)
- This is not to be revealed at any point (author-only worldbuilding).
- Humans are not born on deathworld Earth.
- Humans ran away to the Outer universe to hide and survive.
- Humans are the most stubborn lifeform in the universe; they refuse extinction.
- Humans are the most bloody and power-hungry race, with high intelligence.
- Humans are more prone to war than orcs.
- Humans and the Inner universe do not know about the GRAND SECRET.
- Humans assume they were born on Earth.

### OPEN SLOT (optional but useful)
- The pursuer (who/what forced the escape), the original home, the “scar” left behind, the hidden evidence.

---

# 6) Power System — Mana
## 6.1 Mana as an evolutionary force
### CANON (current)
- Mana is one of the main forces of evolution:
  - It evolved all species in the Inner universe; those who could not evolve died.
- At the beginning of the Inner universe, as life was born, it was tested by mana.
  - First species were **monsters** (not beasts):
    - Beasts have intelligence
    - Beasts have uniform form (race, stable shape and structure)
    - Monsters do not have:
	    - intelligence - but possible very high instinct level
	    - race - all monsters are different
  - Until they evolved to accept mana, they were monsters.

### Mana physics: 
- Mana is omnipresent force on all celestial bodies
-  Mana exist outside celestial bodies (in space) of inner universe in form of current (like water current)
- Mana source is not known
- Mana does not deplete - all beings and things may absorb mana, but when they die, mana returns in some shape to the universe (as mana crystal or just mana)
-  Mana is in "gaseous" state generally.
	 - Under special conditions, mana can condense into mana crystal (resource scarce as copper on Earth)
	- With special technique, mana crystals can be manufactured (but its vary demanding)
- Living beings can store mana in mana pool (mages), aura core (knights), body or body parts (Beasts) 

### Interaction rules: what mana does to biology/technology.
- Mana force evolution of living beings and can strengthen/change objects (minerals, materials, artifacts, etc.)
	- If living being (not yet evolved) do not adapt (evolve) it will die
	- with no guidance and special conditions, loss of sanity and death is vary likely.
	- once evolved, living beings get extended lifespan and ability to use mana to some extant

### Taxonomy: monster vs beast vs sapient species (edge cases).
- **Monster:**
	- can be in any shape
	- can have any ability
	- do not have reproductive ability
	- do not have sanity
	- do not have consciousness
	- have instinct, can have vary strong instinct

- **Beast:**
	- races: dragon, phoenix, Merfolk, Roc, Wolf, Tiger, Vampires (not necessarily human shaped), Arachne, serpent, harpy, three-legged crow, Kun, Bahamut, pegasus, wyvern, drake
	- have race (there are many of same species)
	- have reproductive ability
	- reproductive ability depend on power - the more powerful, smaller reproductive ability
	 - have reproductive ability
	- have sanity
	- have consciousness
	- have civilization and society
	- have laws and rules
	- have intelligence

- **Sapient Species**:
	- **races**: Elf, Dark Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Humans, Beastman etc.

# 10) Story line #1 - The Void Walker
## Premise:

# Story plot-line
Year is 2850. Humans conquered dozens of dead planets, and terraformed them. Human population is nearly half trillion.
In year 2152, humans first detected anomaly on one side of the universe - border from edge to edge of known universe on that side. Humans could not see what is inside.
From year 2204 till now, human have sent many probes, but nothing could pass through the asteroid belt.
Humans started using asteroid belt and fast moving asteroid for development:
- fast moving asteroids were used as practice targets for new weapons
- navigation, targeting and ai systems were trained on movements of asteroids.
- every new weapon was shot at least once at the asteroid belt
Only in year 2583 did humans succeed in making a hole - using power of star and directing its energy as laser to cut a pathway through which they sent probe - automated spaceship for 10 year long mission.Success was achieved  in Gemini Domain, under 4 star general Silver. After 10 years, humans activated Star Canon again, to open the path for the probe to return. Probe returned, but results were confusing - there was nothing - big expanse of just nothing - no celestial bodies, no light, no asteroid or debris, only emptiness. Humans continued to use asteroid belt as training dummy, and from time to time, they would send more and more probes through the barrier. over time, Star Canon was optimized and improved, it needed less time to charge, it shoot more concentrated beam, it needed less time between each shoot. After more then 100 years, Star Canon could shoot once per month and humans send more probes in. After all this time, humans made a chain of miniature space stations to try and find the end of empty space. One of biggest challenges was random appearance of spatial rifts - anomalies that tore through everything and destroyed space stations from time to time. Humans needed to send new space stations regularly to keep chain active. In year 2743, the end was found - another asteroid belt. Greatest minds of human race were gathered and tasked with finding a way to send probes over border. It was decided to use Star Canon, and to fire array of beams on the same spot on the other side - there was no other way. Humans started building array of Star Canons around the closest star. After 122 years from first shot, with a lot of resources of all humanity, project was finished, and 120 Star Canons were connected. This array of Star Canons, called Path Maker, could keep beam continuous for  3 days, and its beam was at 89% of speed of light. Plan was to have a automated space ship with deep space probes and mapping equipment - pinnacle of human technology, go in when beam opens the  way. Space ship was already sent, and waiting in position close to the planed hole. Plan was a success - beam reached the other side and made a path for the spaceship. Spaceship was gone for 6 moths. After 6 months, the hole was opened and spaceship returned. Most of retrieved data was corrupted and malfunctioning, but what was confirmed was that there are celestial bodies and marks of space fearing civilization. Human Earth council started planning for expedition - infiltration. Team was assembled, best operatives of human race. they were sent with fastest, stealthiest and most durable space ship. but in the middle of the travel through the boundary, vary large spatial rift appeared before the space ship, and destroyed it. mission was marked as failed. new missions with humans were postponed. 
Biggest benefit of boundary exploration was development of star canon and star canon array. humans decided to improve their technology.

After accident with spatial rift, officer John Silver awakes in the middle of small forest, close to the dirt road. He gets captured by traveling orc merchant, and gifted (with many other things) to the planet governor. governor did not know what to do with John, so he gifted him to his father, arch mage Casil, and sent John to Casil's magic tower.
Casil is curious about john (since he is not native and he is getting light mana poisoning). Casil cast 6th circle spell for imprinting knowledge on John to teach him language. Casil start testing John and discover that he is not evolved by mana - which is impossible. Casil test John some more, and find that he has potential for magic and even rare space affinity. Casil starts doing light experiments on John, while interrogating him. Casil teach John basic mana gathering technique.
