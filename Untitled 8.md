### 1) Attacker identity + motivation is still “placeholder”

use outline i gave you in last response

- ( **We will change identity of the attacker** - attacker will be part of terrorist/rebel group, and he wont be alone - two 7th circle mages will start attack on tower with group of 6th and 5th mages with a goal of stealing Casil's tower and all resources and killing Casil (famous and respected mage scholar of the Royal magic tower and descendant of ancient mage family)
- The reason Casil left in the hurry is because smaller part of group (1 7th circle mage and group of 6th and 5th circle mage attacked his family). His son (current patriarch of that branch family) sent him SOS and call for help
- John will kill (snipe, ambush) a few 5th circle mages and wound 6th circle mage
	- John will use throwing knives and similar "mortal" weapons (for mages this weapons are less detectable - since they are not used in the fights with mages)
	- John will disrupt combined attack of 7th circle mage and group of 6th circle mages (7th circle mage constructed the war spell and other mages added their mana, so they can pull more ambient mana to cast peak seventh circle war spell)
- Casil will be shocked by John's practical ability (since John will be at 3rd circle at that point)
)

### 2) Knowledge restriction fix conflicts with your universe canon

	I will modify the canon
### 3) John’s evolution endpoint contradicts your message

it will be 0.7

### 4) “John did not evolve” vs the outline

John is not fully evolved - his body did not reach its peak potential, his body did not accept mana completely yet, nor are all his abilities unlocked.

## Questions I need you to answer (then I’ll produce the updated outline + episode structure)

1. **Canon choice (knowledge control):**  
    **change universe canon** so great nobles broadly possess 7th/8th blueprints
    
2. **Final attacker package:**  
	- attackers are mysterious group.
	- Priority is to kill Casil
		- They are trying to destroy the tower since then Casil wont be able to use it as defense.
    

3. **How do they realistically threaten a tower that “can survive 7th circle with no problem”?**  
	    One of the 7th circle mages started to deploy war class peek 7th circle spell, with support of all 6th circle mages. This is enough to open a passage in or to break barriers since there is no one to actively control the tower.
    

4. **John’s evolution endpoint for Story 1:** 0.7 
	- John is not fully evolved - his body did not reach its peak potential, his body did not accept mana completely yet, nor are all his abilities unlocked.
    
6. **Timeline lock:** total time in tower is **6–7 years** as you said—do:
	- Episode-level time skips (years between episodes)
