### Episode 2 — Scene 5: Venting

John didn’t wait for the next session to prove the point.

The tower was already proving it every minute he breathed.

He could feel the pressure behind his teeth swell in slow waves. He could feel his skin tighten across his forearms and chest like something inside him was pushing outward. When he lay still, it got worse. When he moved, it eased a fraction—never enough, but enough to matter.

A one-way system.

Intake was effortless. Output was punished.

So he stopped treating it like magic and started treating it like a bodily problem.

Pressure. Capacity. Drain.

He had survived plenty of things by building a routine that didn’t care about feelings. This would be the same.

He waited until the room was quiet—no footsteps, no pressure-thump at the door, no constructs sliding in with food. He sat on the bed, spine straight, hands on thighs, and closed his eyes.

He found the valve.

The internal sensation wasn’t a literal knob. It was a learned reach—an acceptance reflex his body had built under fire and drowning and darkness. When he opened it, the crowded air responded immediately, sliding into him like a tide finding a channel.

He opened it a touch more.

The pressure behind his teeth eased for half a heartbeat… then snapped back harder, as if the tower had noticed he’d made room and rushed to fill it.

His headache surged.

John stopped intake, breathing shallow until the spike passed.

Okay. Intake control existed, but it wasn’t solving the real issue.

He needed to get rid of excess.

He tried the obvious thing again—on purpose this time, not reflex.

He took a slow breath in. Held it. Focused inward on the mass under his skin—heat-memory, cold-pressure, weight, edge, brightness, absence—no labels, just the sense of too much.

Then he pushed.

Not his arms. Not his lungs.

The *inside* of him.

He tried to force the pressure outward the way you forced breath out of your chest when you’d been winded.

The backlash hit like a hammer.

Pain punched through his skull, white-hot behind the eyes. His jaw clenched hard enough to ache. For a second his vision sparked, even with his eyes shut, as if light had been turned on inside his head.

John’s hand shot to the side of his face. His fingers fumbled. His right hand didn’t obey at all.

He didn’t scream.

He rode it out, breathing in short controlled pulls until the pain dulled into the tower’s usual bruise.

He tried again, smaller.

Same result. Less intense. Still immediate.

The system punished “push.”

So he couldn’t force it out like breath.

He sat there for a full minute, letting his heart rate settle, and shifted to the next approach.

If he couldn’t push, he’d *lead*.

You didn’t force swelling out of tissue; you moved it. You circulated it. You gave it a path that didn’t look like rebellion.

He stood.

The room was small, but it was enough for drills.

He rolled his shoulders once. Twice. Tested the joints. The fire and weight had left him stronger in a way that felt unfair, but the fullness under his skin made even strength feel dangerous—like carrying a weapon with the safety off.

He dropped into a slow squat.

Down. Hold. Up.

His legs shook at the bottom, not from weakness, but from internal pressure pressing on muscle fibers from the inside. He rose anyway and repeated.

Ten. Then ten more.

He felt the pressure shift with movement. Not decrease—shift. Like water sloshing in a container.

He moved to push-ups.

His right hand didn’t like the angle; numb fingers slid instead of gripping. He adjusted—fist on the right side, palm on the left—keeping wrists straight. Down. Up. Slow, controlled.

The first set burned. Not muscle burn. A deeper heat that felt like the stored fire waking up.

He kept going.

After a minute his breathing changed. The crowded air pressed into him less like a tide and more like a current aligning with exertion.

John paused at the top of a push-up and held.

He focused on the internal valve—not to take, not to push, but to *route*.

He pictured the pressure moving with his blood, with his breath, with muscle contraction. Not leaving. Just relocating from “everywhere” to “working.”

He lowered and pushed up again.

Something shifted.

Not dramatic. Not visible.

But the pressure behind his teeth eased by a hair and stayed eased for two full breaths.

John froze at the top, holding himself in place.

He tried to copy what he’d just done.

He didn’t push outward. He didn’t open wide.

He guided the sensation down his arms, toward his hands.

The tingling in his fingertips intensified—left hand first, then a faint echo in the right through the numbness. His palms warmed. The air around his fingers felt slightly different, like the tower’s crowded pressure had found the closest point to skin and wanted out.

John held his breath and concentrated.

A faint shimmer touched the space just above his left hand.

It wasn’t light. It wasn’t smoke.

It was the same kind of wrongness he’d seen in Casil’s demonstrations—subtle distortion, as if the air couldn’t decide how to sit still.

John kept his face blank, alone in his room, but his pulse jumped.

He guided the pressure into his hands again, and this time he didn’t stop at “into.”

He let it *bleed*.

Not a shove. A leak.

The shimmer thickened for a heartbeat.

The pressure under his skin eased.

Not a lot. But enough that his shoulders dropped without him meaning to.

John exhaled slowly.

He held his hands out in front of him, fingers spread, left hand steady, right hand clumsy. He tried again—route down the arms, into the hands, gentle bleed.

The air shimmered faintly.

The pressure behind his teeth eased another notch.

His headache dulled.

He stopped immediately and listened.

Silence. No footsteps. No door-thump.

He did it again.

On the third attempt, the shimmer lasted longer, and he felt the outflow as a cooling sensation under his skin—like sweat evaporating. His lungs expanded more easily. His jaw loosened without effort.

A release valve.

A drain.

He didn’t celebrate. He didn’t grin. He didn’t get greedy.

He had no idea what the limit was, and he wasn’t going to discover it by rupturing in his own room.

He sat down on the bed and braced his elbows on his knees, breathing through the new, quieter ache.

Then he tested the idea that mattered.

If he could route pressure into his hands, could he route it into his feet?

He stood and placed his bare feet flat on the stone.

The stone felt cool. Solid. Unmoving.

He closed his eyes and guided the internal pressure downward—through hips, thighs, calves—toward the soles.

His feet tingled.

The air around his ankles felt tense, like a held breath.

He let it bleed.

For a moment nothing happened. Then the stone under his feet felt… *lighter*. Not physically lighter. Like the pressure he’d been carrying had found a seam at the boundary of skin and ground and slipped away.

He opened his eyes.

No visible glow. No cracks. No sparks.

But the pressure behind his teeth eased again, clean and immediate.

John breathed in and felt, for the first time since waking in this tower, that the air was merely crowded—not crushing.

He stopped.

He sat again.

He waited, counting breaths, to see if the pressure rebounded.

It tried. It rose slowly, like a tide coming back in.

But it didn’t slam into the same unbearable fullness.

The drain was real.

Now the problem changed.

A drain meant control.

Control meant a mistake could show.

If that shimmer ever happened in front of Casil, it would stop being “my body’s reaction” and become “your technique.”

And if Casil realized John could manage intake and output, the tower would change its rules around him. The cage would tighten. The experiments would turn from calibrated torture into dissection.

So John made the next decision the way he made decisions under surveillance.

He built a cover story.

No dramatic sessions. No visible practice.

He would disperse only in the quiet gaps, only in amounts small enough to look like normal post-trauma settling. If anyone saw him tremble, it would read as pain. If anyone saw him breathe hard, it would read as exhaustion.

He didn’t need them to think he was healing.

He needed them to think he was *leaking*.

He got up and began the first routine.

Not a workout. A system.

Slow squats to shift pressure into the legs.

Isometric holds to “seat” the pressure into muscle.

Push-ups with the right hand modified—fist instead of palm—forcing engagement without revealing fine motor improvement.

Then a stillness phase: hands and feet planted, small controlled bleed until the pressure behind his teeth eased into tolerable.

He repeated.

He stopped when his headache threatened to spike.

He listened between sets for footsteps.

He did the whole thing without looking at the door plate, without asking for more room, without touching the grooves around the frame.

He used only his body, because his body was the only thing Casil couldn’t confiscate.

Hours later—or what felt like hours; the tower kept time like it kept mercy—food came.

The pressure-thump announced it. The door opened. The construct entered with the tray and left.

John ate slowly, watching his own hands.

The right hand still lagged, but it wasn’t as dead. When he pinched bread between thumb and forefinger, the grip held a fraction longer before slipping. When he curled his fingers, the motion was a little cleaner.

Tiny gains.

He didn’t chase them.

He chased control.

He waited until the tower quieted again.

Then he dispersed a small amount—hands planted on the table, feet anchored—letting the pressure bleed away in a controlled trickle.

The shimmer was almost invisible now. A hint of wrongness in the air that would be easy to miss unless you were looking for it.

John made sure no one ever had reason to look.

The next lab session came with no warning.

Door-thump. Open. Construct pointing. Escort.

John walked with his face neutral and his chest clear enough to breathe without feeling like he’d split.

That mattered more than strength.

The lab’s circle waited. Casil waited outside it.

Casil’s eyes took John in—the posture, the breathing, the lack of sway, the steadiness.

For a second, John wondered if the elf could smell the difference.

Casil didn’t comment.

He ran the session—another aspect, another density—pain and intrusion and the hook setting in John’s chest.

John endured.

And when the pressure tried to swell past safe limits, he did what he’d practiced.

He didn’t fight. He didn’t push. He routed.

He took what he needed to survive the test, and he held what he could use.

He dispersed the rest later, back in his room, under cover of exhaustion.

Afterward, he lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling while his body repaired itself faster than it should have.

The difference now was that the repair didn’t come with the same creeping terror of accumulation.

He had a drain.

He had a way to keep from bursting.

And a way to turn every session into something else.

Not torture.

Training.

He reached under the mattress and found the knotted strip. He ran his left fingers along the knots, then added another, tight and exact.

Then he added a second knot, smaller, beneath it—an internal mark.

Not for the session.

For the new rule.

He lay back and breathed, feeling the tower’s crowded air press in.

It still wanted entry.

But now he could decide what stayed.

And what left.

In the dark, alone, he practiced a final time—barely a whisper of shimmer between his hands—then cut it off the instant he felt the pressure behind his teeth dip into calm.

He smiled without showing teeth.

The tower had tried to make him a container.

John had just built a valve.

And he wasn’t going to tell anyone until the day it could be used as a weapon.
