### Episode 2 — Scene 1: Stone Wake

Pain brought him up in layers.

First the head—white-hot behind the eyes, like someone had driven a spike through the center and left it there. Then the mouth: copper taste, a torn sting along the side of his tongue. Then the air.

The air was wrong.

Not cold or hot. Not thin. Just *crowded*. It pressed at the back of his teeth and under his skin, like the room was filled with invisible hands leaning in.

John kept his eyes shut and didn’t move.

Rule one: wake up quiet.

He counted breaths. In. Out. In. Out.

The headache didn’t fade. It stayed, pulsing in time with his heart, making each beat a problem to solve.

He forced a body scan anyway.

Neck: stiff, no snap pain. Shoulders: sore. Chest: tight, but breathing was possible. Abdomen: hollow. Thirst, definitely. Legs: present, responsive. Right arm—

He shifted it a centimeter.

The forearm responded, but the hand lagged behind, like it belonged to someone else. Fingers numb, clumsy. The same deadened channels as before, the same unreliable fine motor. Not paralyzed. Not healed.

He opened his eyes.

Stone ceiling. Close. Rough cut blocks, fitted tight with pale mortar. No lights, but the room wasn’t dark. A muted glow seeped from somewhere—no flame, no fixture, just a faint ambient illumination that made shadows soft and untrustworthy.

He turned his head slowly.

Small room. Narrow bed with a thin mattress. A rough wool blanket folded at the foot. A small table. A clay cup. A chamber pot in the corner like an insult.

A slit window high on one wall showed a strip of gray sky and blurred green. Wilderness. No city roofs. No street noise. Just a distant hiss of wind.

And the air-pressure feeling, constant, like the world was breathing too close to him.

He tried to sit up.

The room tilted. The headache flared. He stayed still until the vertigo passed, then pushed again, using his left arm to carry most of the weight.

He got upright.

His clothes weren’t his. Loose cloth, plain and serviceable: shirt, trousers, belt that was more cord than leather. No boots. Wrapped feet in rough socks.

No restraints.

That was not comfort. That was confidence.

He looked for the catch.

The door was solid wood bound with iron bands, set into stone. No visible lock. No handle on his side—just a flat plate, smooth and worn, like the door expected him to wait.

The stone around the frame held faint lines, shallow cuts that didn’t belong to quarry marks. Thin grooves, intentional, meeting at angles that made his eyes want to follow them.

Geometry again.

He swung his legs off the bed and stood.

Knees protested but held. He tested balance—small shifts, weight transfer, left foot then right. The numb right hand made him feel lopsided, but it wasn’t stopping him from moving.

He crossed the room and touched the door plate with his left fingertips.

The wood felt normal. The iron felt normal. The air did not.

He pushed.

Nothing moved. No creak. No give. Not locked—*refused*.

He let his hand fall and stepped back.

Okay. Not a prison in the simple sense. A boundary. A rule.

He catalogued the room like he was clearing a house. Corners. Ceiling. Under the bed. Nothing. No weapons. No tools. No hidden cracks. Just stone, cloth, and the quiet insistence that he did not belong here.

His tongue throbbed when he swallowed. He touched it with his teeth and winced. A bite wound, shallow enough to heal, deep enough to remind him what the spell had done.

He remembered the disc.

Remembered being held down. Remembered the cold certainty in the other man’s hands. Remembered the moment the world narrowed to pain and then snapped—

A sound outside the door cut into the thought.

Footsteps. Two sets. Measured. Not hurried.

John went still. He kept his weight centered, hands visible, posture neutral.

The footsteps stopped.

Something clicked—not metal, not wood. More like a pressure change in the air, a soft *thump* he felt in his molars.

Then the door opened.

Not outward. Not inward. It simply *ceased* to be a barrier and became an opening, as if permission had been granted to the room itself.

A construct stepped through first.

It was humanoid in the broad sense: head, torso, arms, legs. Built from dark stone and pale wood, jointed with brass pins. Its movements weren’t smooth—they were precise. Each step landed exactly where it intended, with no wasted adjustment.

It carried a tray.

A bowl of something steaming. A chunk of bread. A second clay cup filled to the rim with water.

John didn’t move.

The construct crossed to the table, set the tray down with careful placement, and turned back toward the door. No speech. No eye contact. No hesitation.

A servant tool. Not a guard.

It exited and the door remained open behind it for a breath… then shut with the same pressure-thump, sealing the room back into its rule.

John waited ten seconds.

Then he moved to the tray.

He leaned close and smelled the bowl. Broth, maybe. Meat fat. Herbs he didn’t recognize. Not rotten. Not chemical. Not baited, as far as his senses could tell.

He touched the cup and felt the water vibrate faintly against his fingertips, like the liquid was alive with a subtle tension.

Mana. Whatever this place called it, he could feel it.

He stared at the water for a long moment, then drank.

Cool, clean. It hit his throat and sat in his stomach like a small mercy. He drank half and stopped. There was no reason to empty anything in one go.

He ate the bread next, tearing it with his left hand. His right tried to pinch a piece and failed; fingers didn’t coordinate. He didn’t force it. He worked around it.

The broth went down last. Warm, salty, real food. His body accepted it with the blunt gratitude of a machine receiving fuel.

Halfway through the bowl, he realized something and froze.

He’d been thinking in English.

But the footsteps outside, the cadence of speech he’d heard—he hadn’t processed it as foreign.

He set the spoon down.

He listened.

Faint sounds beyond the stone: another set of steps, a low murmur—words.

And his brain… understood them.

Not perfectly. Not comfortably. The meaning arrived with a sting behind his eyes, as if comprehension was being dragged through damaged tissue.

But it arrived.

He stared at the door.

*So it worked.*

Language. They’d jammed it into him like a knife and called it a favor. The pain behind his eyes wasn’t random; it was the aftershock of something rewritten.

He tested the idea the only safe way—silently, internally, on simple words.

*Door. Stone. Water. Up. Down.*

The meanings held.

He tried to shape a response in his mouth, without sound.

His tongue flexed. The bite wound complained. His head spiked.

He exhaled, slow.

Okay. Understanding was present. Speaking might be expensive.

He cleaned the bowl with the bread and set the tray back as it had been. He didn’t know what counted as “correct behavior” here, but leaving messes was a good way to invite attention.

He returned to the bed and sat, back straight, hands resting on his thighs. Not submissive. Not challenging. Just ready.

Time passed in a way that made his skin itch.

He had no clock. No sun angle he could see clearly from the slit window. No sounds of a household. The tower felt like a sealed machine.

The air-pressure feeling never left. If anything, once he noticed it, it became harder to ignore.

He breathed through it anyway.

Footsteps came again.

This time only one set—lighter, controlled.

The pressure-thump hit the room.

The door opened.

He didn’t rise. He didn’t bow. He kept his eyes forward.

A dark elf stood in the doorway.

Tall. Pale gray skin with a faint bluish cast in the ambient light. Long white hair tied back cleanly. Sharp cheekbones, elegant features that would have read as beautiful in a different context—if the eyes weren’t so flat.

Those eyes were a deep, dark color that didn’t reflect the room’s glow. They looked like someone had poured ink into glass.

Casil.

John didn’t know the name from experience, but the memory of the study—of hands, of certainty—slotted into the image with no effort. This was the man who had made him seize on a table and called it education.

Casil stepped into the room without looking around. He already knew everything in it. He wore a long robe of dark fabric with subtle stitched patterns that caught the light when he moved, like threads laid into the cloth with purpose.

No visible weapons. No armor. No guards.

The room felt smaller with him inside.

John kept his face neutral. He let the headache show only as what it was—damage, not fear.

Casil’s gaze tracked over John with the same clinical attention a tech used on a broken tool.

“Awake,” Casil said.

The word hit John’s brain and resolved into meaning with a sharp pulse of pain. He didn’t flinch.

Casil continued, voice calm, slightly accented in a way John couldn’t place. “The language imprint did not kill you. That is… promising.”

John held eye contact.

Casil’s gaze dropped to John’s right hand. He watched the fingers with the interest of someone studying a defect.

“The nerve injury persists,” Casil said. “As expected.”

John said nothing.

Silence stretched.

Casil’s expression didn’t change, but something in the air shifted—subtle, like the room waiting for compliance.

“Do you understand me?” Casil asked.

John weighed options.

If he stayed silent, Casil might assume failure and repeat the procedure. If he answered too much, he gave away clarity and control.

Minimal.

John drew breath. The headache sharpened as he formed the word.

“Yes.”

The sound came out rough. His tongue scraped the bite wound. Pain flared, then settled into the larger ache.

Casil watched him speak as if he’d just confirmed a hypothesis.

“Good,” Casil said. “Then there is no need to waste time.”

He stepped closer, stopping at a distance that was not accidental. Close enough to dominate. Far enough to avoid instinctive reach.

“You are property,” Casil said. “Legally transferred. Sealed. Witnessed. Documented.”

Each term landed like a stamp. John didn’t know the full system, but he recognized the structure: paperwork as weapon. Ownership as ritual.

Casil’s eyes stayed on John’s face. “You were gifted to me by a provincial authority seeking favor. That means your continued existence is, for now, useful.”

Useful. Not *valued*. Not *safe*.

Casil shifted his hands behind his back. “I will study you. I will test you. If you cooperate, you will live longer. If you resist, you will live less comfortably.”

John kept still.

“This is not a negotiation,” Casil added, as if the thought bored him. “Escape is not possible. The tower does not open for you. The wards will not permit it. The wilderness beyond is not survivable without resources you do not possess.”

John noted the phrasing. Not survivable. Not worth attempting. A warning wrapped around a statement of fact.

Casil’s gaze flicked to John’s right arm again. “You are wounded. That makes you honest. Pain is difficult to fake.”

John almost smiled at that, but didn’t. Dark humor wasn’t armor here; it was fuel for someone else’s curiosity.

Casil continued, “There are rules.”

John waited. He listened. He let the words settle despite the headache, building a mental list.

“First: You will not attack me,” Casil said. “It would be pointless. But you are human. Humans are… aggressive. I will state it anyway.”

John stared back, expression empty.

“Second: You will not attempt to leave your assigned spaces without permission,” Casil said. “The wards will stop you. If you push against them repeatedly, they will injure you. If you injure yourself, I will not repair you out of kindness.”

Third: the tower could hurt him without Casil lifting a finger.

“Third: You will eat, drink, and rest when provided,” Casil said. “A dead subject produces no data.”

Subject.

Casil tilted his head slightly, like he was hearing a sound John couldn’t. “You will speak only when asked. You will answer questions honestly. If you do not, I will know.”

John’s stomach tightened.

That wasn’t bluff phrasing. It was too casual.

He filed it under *unknown mechanism*.

Casil’s voice stayed calm. “You may ask questions. I may answer them, if I find them relevant. Do not mistake this for courtesy.”

John considered asking about Renn. About the others. About where he was. About how to get out.

He asked nothing.

Questions were a currency. He didn’t know the exchange rate yet.

Casil watched him for a long moment, as if measuring the shape of his restraint.

“Special forces,” Casil said abruptly.

John’s blood cooled.

Casil said it like a label pulled from a shelf, not like a guess. “Your posture. Your breathing. The way you wake. The way you look at doors.”

John didn’t react. He kept his eyes steady. He didn’t confirm. He didn’t deny.

Casil’s mouth twitched, not quite a smile. “You will adapt. That is what humans do. I intend to see how.”

He turned slightly, gaze sliding toward the slit window and back. “This world is mana-rich. Your origin is not. You are an anomaly that has already survived conditions that kill most.”

John’s head pulsed harder, as if the words *mana-rich* wanted to connect to something in his brain and found only raw nerve.

Casil stepped back toward the door. “You will remain here until summoned. The constructs will bring food and water. Do not interfere with them.”

He paused at the threshold and looked over his shoulder. “Tomorrow, we begin.”

Then he left.

The door sealed with the pressure-thump, and the room returned to its quiet.

John sat on the edge of the bed and breathed through the headache.

The rules were clear enough: he was owned, he was contained, and the tower itself was part of the cage.

But there was a crack in it already.

Casil had called him an anomaly. He’d said humans adapted. He’d said this world was saturated with something John could *feel* pressing on his teeth.

If the environment was a weapon, it was also a resource.

John stared at his right hand.

Numb. Weak. Untrustworthy.

He flexed the fingers anyway. One by one. Slow. Controlled.

No progress. Not yet.

He let the hand rest and leaned back, eyes on the stone ceiling.

Survive. Learn rules. Turn rules into leverage.

He closed his eyes and let the pain remind him what failure looked like.

Tomorrow, they began.

And so did he.

**Change log (Scene 1):** John wakes in servant quarters; confirms language imprint took (with headache); inventories injuries and environment; meets construct service; Casil establishes ownership and tower rules; John commits internally to survival through rule-learning and adaptation.
