### Episode 2 — Scene 6: Hands Return

John learned the tower’s calendar by what it did to him.

He stopped trying to count mornings. The light in his slit window stayed gray more often than not, and the tower’s glow never shifted enough to trust. Meals arrived when they arrived. Sessions came when Casil wanted data.

So John built his own markers.

One knot per exposure.

One quiet mark beneath it for dispersion practice that actually worked.

By the time the strip under his mattress felt thick between his fingers, the pain behind his eyes had changed from a knife into a bruise that never fully faded. It still spiked when he spoke too much. It still pulsed after heavy intake. But it didn’t own him anymore.

The pressure under his skin was worse.

Not because it was stronger—because he could feel it better now.

Dispersion solved “bursting.” It didn’t solve the truth beneath it: every session added mass to him, and every night he had to bleed it off like a man draining poison from a wound.

He kept bleeding.

He kept getting stronger.

And his right hand kept coming back.

It started as pins-and-needles in the dead parts—brief, ugly sparks of sensation that made him want to shake his hand out. He didn’t. He treated it like a signal, not relief.

Then the border moved.

The numbness didn’t vanish in a moment. It retreated the way fog retreats: slow, uneven, leaving clear patches that came and went, then stayed.

He tested it obsessively in the only ways he could without tools.

Bread crumbs.

Cloth fibers.

Knots in a torn strip of blanket.

He’d pinch a crumb between thumb and forefinger with the right hand until his fingers slipped, then repeat. He’d rub cloth between numb pads until he could tell rough from smooth without looking. He’d tie and untie cords until his fingertips burned, then disperse a thin thread of pressure through his hands to quiet the burn before it became visible injury.

In the beginning, the right hand failed constantly.

Later, it failed less.

Then it started to *work*.

The day he realized it, he was sitting on the bed with the food tray on his knees, tearing bread with his left hand. A small piece broke off and fell toward the floor.

Instinct took it.

His right hand snapped out and caught it in the air.

Clean.

No clumsy swipe. No lag. Just a catch—thumb and forefinger closing on the falling crumb like they’d done it a thousand times.

John froze with the bread pinched between his fingers.

He held it there and waited for the tremor, the delayed pain, the numb lag.

Nothing.

His fingers were steady.

His breath went shallow for half a beat, then he forced it normal again. He didn’t smile. He didn’t even look at the door. He just set the bread down and opened the valve a fraction to bleed off the sudden surge inside him that was not mana—just adrenaline.

When the pressure behind his teeth eased, he tested again.

He picked up the clay cup with his right hand.

The grip held.

He rotated it slowly, feeling the curve, the weight, the faint vibration in the water.

His fingers didn’t slip.

He set the cup down as if it didn’t matter.

And then, very carefully, he began the next phase.

If the hand was back, the hand was also a liability.

Casil had already noticed everything else that changed. Posture. Breathing. Collapse threshold. Recovery time.

If Casil realized the right hand was fully restored—after weeks of “expected persistence”—then the tower’s experiments would change. The cage would tighten around the new data point.

So John rebuilt his mask around competence.

In the lab, he stayed clumsy.

He let his right fingers lag when a band released him. He fumbled simple grips. He let objects slip *just enough* to confirm the story Casil already believed: nerve damage persisted, improvement was slow, and any “leakage” was involuntary.

Outside the lab, in the quiet gaps, he trained like his life depended on it—because it did.

He forced fine motor precision without tools: rolling crumbs into pellets, splitting threads, tying knots with eyes closed.

He forced strength without showing bulk: isometric holds, slow controlled tension, then dispersion to keep the internal pressure from swelling into visible strain.

He forced endurance by treating Casil’s torture cycles like weighted training. Take. Hold. Survive. Return. Disperse. Repair. Repeat.

The tower gave him pain.

He turned it into adaptation.

Casil varied aspects the way a man might vary blades in a workshop.

Fire came again, denser and tighter than the first time, as if Casil had decided to see what happened when the burn wasn’t allowed to spread.

John took it and held it behind his ribs, keeping his face empty while his blood felt like it wanted to boil.

Water came in thin streams instead of the basin—forced into his lungs and sinuses in controlled doses until his chest spasmed and his eyes watered.

John took what mattered in it and let the rest run out of him later in his room, bleeding pressure through his hands until the scrape in his throat eased into soreness.

Weight came with sudden shifts—crush, release, crush—testing joints and tendons. Wind edges returned, faster and more precise, carving lines that closed before blood could fully run.

Light and dark came in alternating bursts designed to confuse his senses and break rhythm.

John didn’t break.

He didn’t because he was brave.

He didn’t because he was building a routine, and routines didn’t care how unfair the inputs were.

After one session, back in his room, he sat on the bed and looked at his hands under the tower’s faint glow.

Both hands trembled.

Not from weakness.

From being too full.

He opened the valve and routed pressure down both arms, into both palms, then bled it into the air in a controlled leak.

A faint shimmer gathered between his fingers—subtle distortion, like heat haze that refused to behave like heat.

He cut it off instantly and listened.

Silence.

He waited for the pressure rebound.

It rose, slow, like tidewater.

He bled again, smaller.

The pressure behind his teeth eased into tolerable.

Then he did something he hadn’t dared yet.

He routed pressure into his right hand, specifically into the areas that had been dead.

He bled it out slowly, letting the tingling ride the nerve paths like a signal traveling over repaired wiring.

Warmth spread through his fingertips.

Not the burn of fire. The warmth of circulation.

He flexed his fingers.

Perfect.

He closed his fist and opened it again.

Perfect.

He stared at the knotted strip under the mattress, then added a knot—tight and exact—and beneath it, a second small mark.

Not for survival.

For capability.

Two sessions later, Casil tested him with restraints that demanded coordination.

Bands rose and wrapped his wrists, but instead of holding him still they forced his hands into specific positions—palms down, palms up, fingers splayed, fingers curled—like Casil was watching the relationship between intention and response.

“Move,” Casil said.

The command resolved behind John’s eyes with a sting.

John moved his left hand cleanly.

Then he moved his right—*almost* cleanly.

He let two fingers lag. He let the motion shake slightly as if the nerves were still unreliable. He let his thumb hesitate.

It cost him. Not physically—psychologically. Like deliberately stepping wrong on a staircase you could walk in the dark.

Casil watched without expression.

Then Casil produced the thin etched rod again and brought it close to John’s forearm without touching.

The air around the rod tightened, and John felt a faint tug under his skin like something being measured.

Casil moved the rod along the length of John’s right arm, from elbow to wrist.

John held still, breathing through his nose.

The rod paused near the wrist—right where sensation had been worst.

Casil’s eyes narrowed by a fraction.

He didn’t speak. He shifted the rod a hair closer and held it there.

John felt the internal pressure respond. Not because he wanted it to—because the tower’s crowded air and the mass inside him recognized a boundary and pressed against it.

A shimmer flickered in the space between rod and skin.

Barely visible.

Barely there.

But Casil saw it.

John knew it the way he knew when a room had gone quiet before a fight.

Casil withdrew the rod and looked at it as if confirming the reading.

Then he looked at John.

“You leak,” Casil said.

The word hit John’s brain and resolved with a sharp pulse.

John kept his face blank.

“Containment failure,” Casil continued, voice calm, almost annoyed. “A flaw.”

John said nothing.

Casil turned away, robe patterns shifting subtly as he moved, and paced along the edge of the circle without stepping into it.

“You accept all aspects,” Casil said, not to John now but to his own model of reality. “You ingest. You adapt. But you do not retain properly.”

John’s stomach tightened.

That was the wrong conclusion.

It was also exactly what John needed Casil to believe.

Casil stopped and looked back at him. “This reduces your value as a stable subject.”

John kept his breathing steady. He made his right hand twitch once, as if in pain, as if the word *leak* had become a symptom.

Casil watched, satisfied by the confirmation he’d manufactured.

“I will not waste resources on a vessel that cannot hold,” Casil said. “You will still be useful.”

John’s pulse jumped, controlled and silent.

Useful meant two things here: better conditions or a different kind of exploitation.

Casil’s eyes flicked to the lab tables. The jars. The circles. The straps.

Then to the corridor beyond, where other doors waited.

“Return,” Casil said, and made a small gesture.

The bands released.

A construct stepped forward as escort.

John walked out of the lab on steady legs, right hand loose at his side, left hand relaxed, face empty.

Inside, he was counting.

Not sessions.

Not knots.

Steps.

Doors.

Access points.

Because “not wasting resources” could mean fewer restraints.

It could mean mobility.

It could mean being brought closer to the parts of the tower Casil guarded with rules instead of iron.

Back in his room, the door sealed with the pressure-thump.

John waited until the silence settled.

Then he raised his right hand in front of him and flexed his fingers—slow, precise, flawless.

He opened the valve and bled a controlled thread of pressure through his palms until the tightness under his skin eased into calm.

He stopped before the shimmer could grow.

He sat on the bed and stared at the door plate.

Casil thought he’d found a flaw.

John had built a valve.

And now the man who owned the tower was about to rearrange John’s place inside it—because of the valve, not despite it.

John reached under the mattress, touched the knotted strip, and added one more mark beneath the latest knot.

A small one.

Not for a session.

For an opportunity.

**Change log (Scene 6):** Time compresses into repeated torture cycles; John’s private dispersion routine becomes stable and discreet; right-hand nerve damage fully resolves and fine motor returns (and improves), but he hides it; Casil detects a faint shimmer during measurement and mislabels it as “leakage/containment failure,” setting up a change in how John will be used in the tower.
