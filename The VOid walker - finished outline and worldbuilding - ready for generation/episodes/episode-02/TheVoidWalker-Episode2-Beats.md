## Beat Cards

### Scene 2.1 / Stone Wake / Ep2 #1

* **POV:** John

* **Setting + time:** Small stone servant room; first wake after blackout

* **Scene goal (John):** Orient, inventory, identify control mechanisms

* **Opposition / pressure:** Migraine, mana-thick air, confinement, unknown rules

* **Turn (what changes):** Casil states John’s status and the tower’s rules

* **Exit hook:** “Tomorrow we begin.” (experiments implied)

* **Beats (cause → effect):**

  * Comes to mid-pain; forces breathing steady; tests memory vs present.
  * Hears speech outside; realizes he *understands* it; tries forming words—pain spikes.
  * Checks arms: damage still there, but usable; fingers unreliable.
  * Scans room: door seams, stonework, any etched geometry; notes “crowded” air pressure.
  * A basic construct delivers water/food; John watches for tricks, eats anyway.
  * Door opens without keys—permission-based, not mechanical.
  * Casil arrives, clinical; labels John property/research subject.
  * Rules laid down: obedience, no escape attempts, cooperation buys time.
  * John gives nothing back; stores every detail; internal pivot: survive → learn → leverage.

* **Rules check:** Language spell functioning (with headache); John has absorption but no casting; tower access is ward/permission-based.

### Scene 2.2 / Fire Lesson / Ep2 #2

* **POV:** John

* **Setting + time:** Tower lab; same day/next day

* **Scene goal (John):** Survive first procedure; learn the “shape” of the threat

* **Opposition / pressure:** Restraints + Casil’s direct mana injection (fire)

* **Turn (what changes):** John realizes his body *absorbs* what should kill him

* **Exit hook:** He heals faster than he should—Casil notices

* **Beats:**

  * Escorted through corridors; John maps turns, doors, ward-marked thresholds.
  * Lab reveal: circles, tables, implements—built for repeat suffering, not execution.
  * Casil explains nothing useful; begins anyway.
  * Fire-aspected mana hits like internal ignition; John clamps down on panic.
  * Instinct: he “pulls” at the burning to survive—mana drains into him instead of consuming him.
  * Pain drops from “ending” to “bearable”; he stays conscious by choice.
  * Casil records absorption rate; interest replaces indifference.
  * Back in the room: burns knit overnight; John tests grip, sensation—tiny gains.

* **Rules check:** Universal absorption is active; no element-specific rejection; John still can’t project spells—everything stays internal.

### Scene 2.3 / Drowning & Weight / Ep2 #3

* **POV:** John

* **Setting + time:** Lab cycles over days

* **Scene goal (John):** Endure without breaking; extract a pattern he can use

* **Opposition / pressure:** Water (drowning) and earth (crushing/gravity) stress tests

* **Turn (what changes):** Recovery is not “rest”—it’s active mana intake and adaptation

* **Exit hook:** John starts counting cycles like a training schedule

* **Beats:**

  * Water test: forced submersion; throat and lungs seize; John rides the urge to thrash.
  * He feels mana threaded through the water; absorption kicks in during the worst seconds.
  * Released: coughs blood, then the damage reverses faster than biology allows.
  * Earth test: weight stacks onto him; stone binds compress ribs and joints.
  * Instead of resisting, John “opens” to intake—pain converts into reinforcement.
  * After release, bones/muscle feel denser; fatigue changes character (less fragility, more load).
  * Casil notes structural reinforcement like it’s a curiosity, not a miracle.
  * John begins an internal log: test → recovery window → what improved.

* **Rules check:** Absorption strengthens tissues; healing accelerates post-exposure; Casil’s methods are cruel but calibrated to keep the subject alive.

### Scene 2.4 / Edges & Darkness / Ep2 #4

* **POV:** John

* **Setting + time:** Continued lab cycles; later in the first month(s)

* **Scene goal (John):** Confirm whether any element can “beat” him—and what the cost is

* **Opposition / pressure:** Wind lacerations; light/dark sensory extremes; cumulative stress

* **Turn (what changes):** “No rejection” becomes certain—then internal pressure becomes a new threat

* **Exit hook:** John realizes absorption alone ends in rupture

* **Beats:**

  * Wind test: cutting air blades; John bleeds in controlled slices.
  * He pulls mana at the wound edges; closures become faster, cleaner.
  * Light: blinding overload; darkness: absolute deprivation—Casil testing mind as much as flesh.
  * John uses compartmentalization; refuses to give Casil a reaction worth keeping.
  * Pattern locks: fire/water/earth/wind/light/dark—everything feeds him.
  * New symptom: headaches, skin-tightness, a sense of “too full.”
  * Quiet terror: he’s becoming a container with no safe outlet.
  * Back in quarters, he tests breathing and focus—pressure doesn’t leave.
  * Conclusion: if he keeps absorbing, he eventually bursts.

* **Rules check:** Universal absorption has a capacity problem (“shell” filling); John still lacks external casting—no natural release valve.

### Scene 2.5 / Venting / Ep2 #5

* **POV:** John

* **Setting + time:** Nights and stolen moments; between lab cycles

* **Scene goal (John):** Create an outlet before the buildup kills him

* **Opposition / pressure:** No teacher, no tools, risk of catastrophic failure, constant surveillance risk

* **Turn (what changes):** John invents mana dispersion—venting + circulation tied to movement

* **Exit hook:** He can now use torture cycles as controlled evolution, not just suffering

* **Beats:**

  * First attempt: tries to “push” mana out—gets internal backlash, worse pressure.
  * Switches tactics: treats it like rehab—movement, repetition, controlled strain.
  * Links intake to exertion; finds a flow path: in through skin, out through hands/feet.
  * Air shimmers faintly around him when it works; pressure behind teeth eases.
  * Immediate effect: wounds calm; nerves spark; recovery becomes regeneration.
  * He codifies a routine: morning exertion + venting; post-test circulation; rest-phase gentle flow.
  * He hides the visible signs; lets Casil believe it’s involuntary leakage.
  * For the first time, John isn’t just surviving—he’s steering.

* **Rules check:** Dispersion is controlled venting/circulation; it boosts healing/strengthening but requires focus and is used as training, not a permanent “on” state.

### Scene 2.6 / Hands Return / Ep2 #6

* **POV:** John

* **Setting + time:** Weeks passing (month markers implied)

* **Scene goal (John):** Restore fine motor control and strength without alerting Casil

* **Opposition / pressure:** Nerve damage + Casil’s observation + need to stay underestimated

* **Turn (what changes):** Arms fully restore—better than baseline

* **Exit hook:** Casil spots “leakage” and makes the wrong call

* **Beats:**

  * Week 1: tingling returns; John tests fingertips on stone seams, fabric threads.
  * Week 2: controlled pinches, grip endurance; tremor fades.
  * Week 3: strength returns; he calibrates quietly—no visible shows of power.
  * Week 4: full function; precision improves past original baseline.
  * In lab, he performs “still damaged” on command—keeps the mask consistent.
  * Dispersion becomes his private edge: heal fast, harden tissue, expand tolerance.
  * Casil watches the venting effect and mislabels it as failure to contain mana.

* **Rules check:** Dispersion repairs nerves and reinforces body; concealment matters—Casil’s assumptions drive John’s freedom.

### Scene 2.7 / Servant Keys / Ep2 #7

* **POV:** John

* **Setting + time:** Tower interior; immediately after Casil’s reclassification

* **Scene goal (John):** Turn demotion into mobility and access

* **Opposition / pressure:** Still owned; wards, constructs, and rules everywhere

* **Turn (what changes):** John gains movement + library access

* **Exit hook:** First magic theory text in his hands—education begins

* **Beats:**

  * Casil declares John “defective”: can’t hold mana properly; not worth high-value testing.
  * New orders: servant duties—clean labs, fetch materials, assist constructs.
  * John accepts without protest; obedience as camouflage.
  * He uses routes to memorize tower flow: storage, labs, ward thresholds, choke points.
  * Servant work becomes covert training: controlled exertion + dispersion under cover.
  * He identifies the library’s access ritual (permission/construct-mediated, not a simple lock).
  * First entry: shelves of theory; John chooses foundational text—circles, mana handling, rules of the world.
  * Final beat: he reads with the same focus he once used on mission briefs—only now the “weapon” is reality itself.

* **Rules check:** Casil’s authority governs access; knowledge is the real resource; John still can’t cast non-void, but he’s building the framework to exploit what he *can* do.
