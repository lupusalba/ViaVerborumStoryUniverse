### Episode 2 — Scene 7: Servant Keys

Casil didn’t summon John to the circle.

He summoned him to the threshold.

The escort came as usual—pressure-thump, door opening, construct pointing—but when John reached the lab corridor the lead construct didn’t turn down the stairs. It continued straight, past the familiar junctions, toward a section of the tower John had only seen from a distance: a wider hall with cleaner stonework and denser grooves cut into the walls.

Different infrastructure. Different rules.

John kept his pace steady and his face empty.

The air here felt tighter. Not heavier—more *directed*. Like the tower’s crowded pressure knew exactly where it wanted to flow.

They stopped before a door set into stone with no seam visible except a thin line that ran around its perimeter. No handle. No plate. Just a smooth surface that looked poured rather than built.

Casil stood beside it, hands behind his back, posture calm in a way that made calm feel threatening.

His eyes tracked John and then, briefly, John’s right hand.

“You continue to leak,” Casil said.

The words resolved in John’s skull with the usual stab of post-spell pain. He didn’t react. He didn’t correct. He let the lie stand because it was not his job to fix Casil’s assumptions.

Casil’s gaze remained flat. “Containment failure makes you an unreliable vessel.”

John breathed through his nose, slow and controlled.

Casil moved one hand, two fingers lifting as if turning a page. The air pulsed faintly.

The sealed door beside him responded—not by opening, but by acknowledging him. The perimeter line caught the glow for half a second, then went dull again.

Permission, not mechanics. Always.

Casil looked back at John. “I will not continue high-resource testing at the current rate,” he said. “You are still anomalous. You are still useful. But not as a stable subject.”

John kept his face blank.

Useful could mean anything from “clean my floors” to “cut you open later.”

Casil’s mouth moved, not quite a smile—more like a decision settling into place. “You will serve.”

The words landed with weight because they weren’t a threat. They were a rearrangement.

“You will clean,” Casil continued. “You will carry. You will assist the constructs. You will remain available when I require you. You will not leave assigned spaces without permission.”

John nodded once. Minimal. Compliant.

Casil watched the nod like it confirmed something he’d already concluded.

“And,” Casil added, voice mild, “you will not touch what you do not understand.”

John didn’t answer.

He understood enough to know Casil wasn’t talking about cups and brooms.

Casil gestured with a small motion of his hand. A construct stepped forward holding an object: a narrow band of dark metal, thin as a cuff, etched with lines too fine to be decoration.

It wasn’t a shackle. It was too neat. Too deliberate.

The construct held it out.

John extended his left wrist.

He kept his right hand relaxed and slightly clumsy at his side, fingers loose as if they didn’t fully listen.

The band closed around his left wrist with a soft click.

A faint pressure touched his skin under the metal—like a fingertip pressing lightly, then settling.

Not painful. Not constricting.

Present.

Casil’s eyes flicked to the band. “That mark identifies your function,” he said. “It allows doors to recognize you. It does not allow them to obey you.”

John listened and paid for it with a dull pulse behind his eyes.

A function mark. A permission token.

A leash with longer range.

Casil turned away as if the matter was finished. “Begin.”

He walked off down the hall without escort, the tower yielding to him in silent, seamless ways.

The constructs turned. John followed.

They moved through corridors John hadn’t walked before. Cleaner. Wider. The grooves in the stone were more intricate here—braided lines, layered rings around arches, shallow channels that ran along the floor like veins.

He watched every threshold.

At each doorway, the lead construct touched stone, and the pressure in the air shifted. Sometimes the shift came from the walls. Sometimes from the band on John’s wrist—a faint warming sensation that coincided with the door’s acceptance.

Recognition, not control. Exactly as Casil said.

They passed a stairwell that spiraled upward into darker levels. They passed a narrow hall that sloped downward, air colder, pressure thicker. They passed a set of double doors inlaid with patterns that made John’s eyes want to slide away.

He logged them all.

The constructs stopped at a storage room. The door didn’t open until the lead construct pressed its palm to a recessed plate and held it there for a beat too long, as if waiting for the tower to confirm identity.

The room inside smelled of oil, stone dust, and dried herbs.

Shelves held folded cloth, simple tools, jars, buckets, cords, brushes. Not weapons. Not luxury. Support.

The lead construct lifted a bucket. Set it in John’s reach.

Another construct placed a bundle of cloth beside it.

Then the lead construct pointed toward a corridor.

Clean.

John picked up the bucket with his left hand.

He let his right hover near it and then fail to assist properly, a deliberate clumsiness. The bucket shifted. He corrected with his left arm and kept moving.

The mask stayed on.

They led him to the lab’s outer corridor first—not the circle chamber, but the rooms around it. Workspaces. Tables. A floor with faint stains that didn’t fully come out no matter how many times someone scrubbed.

The constructs watched without emotion while John knelt and began to work.

Scrub. Rinse. Wipe.

The cloth was rough. The water in the bucket vibrated faintly with the tower’s pressure. Every motion made the band on his wrist sit against his skin, a constant reminder that he had been reclassified, not freed.

John worked steadily.

He kept his breathing controlled. He kept his face neutral. He kept his head slightly down while his eyes tracked everything: corner seams, groove patterns, how the floor lines converged at certain points and avoided others, where the air felt tighter and where it felt merely crowded.

Every corridor was a map.

Every stain was a marker for where pain happened.

Every doorway was a test of permissions.

The work wasn’t hard. It was *useful*.

Because it moved him.

By the end of the first day of servitude—if it was a day—he had walked more of the tower than he had in all the prior sessions combined.

He learned which doors opened for constructs alone, which doors required a living bearer with a function mark, and which doors didn’t open at all unless Casil was present.

He learned that some thresholds made the pressure behind his teeth flare—ward density, like a field line his body didn’t like crossing.

He learned which corridors were “servant routes” and which were reserved, not by signage, but by geometry: grooves that tightened into warning patterns near certain turns, the air growing taut as if the tower anticipated disobedience.

He didn’t test boundaries by forcing them.

He tested them by watching how the tower behaved when he stayed inside the rules.

The second assignment was carrying.

They loaded him with folded cloth and jars from storage to a workroom where constructs assembled things that looked like simple household tools until you noticed the etched lines hidden under handles and rims.

John lifted and carried without strain.

He let the strain show anyway.

Not all of it. Just enough.

When a jar slipped slightly in his grasp, he made his right hand fumble, then corrected with his left. He moved like a man still healing, still damaged, still lesser than he might become.

Inside, his body wanted to disperse constantly. Not because he was overloaded now—because the tower’s ambient pressure kept feeding him and movement kept giving it paths.

He didn’t disperse openly.

He waited for the right cover.

When he carried weight up stairs and his breathing deepened, he let a controlled bleed happen through the soles of his feet, subtle enough to look like nothing. The pressure behind his teeth eased. His headache dulled. His posture remained stable.

When he knelt to scrub and the bucket water vibrated against his hands, he routed a thread into his palms and bled it away in a whisper of shimmer too small to notice unless someone stood inches from his fingers and stared.

No one did.

Constructs didn’t stare.

That was another rule.

Casil’s tower ran on attention. Constructs did not have it unless ordered.

John used that.

A few cycles into servitude, the task list changed.

He was escorted to a room John recognized from memory, not route.

The study.

Same rough stone, same shelves, same table where the disc had been pressed into his brain. The fireplace with dead ash. The air here was different from the rest of the tower—thicker with intent, as if this room had been built around Casil’s mind.

Casil wasn’t present.

That mattered.

A construct pointed at the shelves. Then at the floor. Then at a stack of books on the table.

Organize. Clean.

John moved carefully.

He did not touch anything that looked like it wanted to be touched back.

He started with the floor, sweeping dust and grit from corners. He watched the carved lines embedded in the stone near the shelves, noting which patterns repeated.

Then he approached the table.

The books were bound in dark material—leather, maybe, or something like it. Some had metal clasps. Some had no markings at all. One had a symbol pressed into the cover that made John’s eyes tighten, like his brain didn’t like the shape.

He didn’t open that one.

He cleaned around it and left it exactly as it sat.

He picked up a plain-looking volume with no clasp and moved it to align with the stack.

The band on his wrist warmed faintly.

A response to proximity? To contact? To categories of object?

John held still and let the warmth fade, then set the book down gently.

He shifted to the shelves.

Most volumes were packed tightly, spine to spine. The ordering wasn’t alphabetical. It wasn’t by size. It felt like *function*, like a system built by someone who didn’t care about casual browsing.

John slid one book into alignment and noticed something behind the back row: a recessed plate in the stone, partially hidden by the shelf’s support strut.

He didn’t touch it. He just noted it.

Hidden controls. Hidden permissions.

The study wasn’t just a room. It was a node.

When the floor was clean and the shelves were straight, the lead construct pointed again—toward a side door John hadn’t been through before.

The side door had a plate.

The lead construct pressed it.

The perimeter line brightened, the air pulsed, and the door opened into a narrower corridor that smelled like dry paper and old dust.

John’s pulse stayed steady.

He followed.

The corridor ended at another door, this one taller, with shallow grooves that formed nested rectangles around it, like frames around frames around frames.

A library door.

John knew it before he saw inside.

The air here felt different—less crowded, more… organized. Like the pressure wasn’t just present; it was arranged.

The lead construct pressed a plate beside the door.

Nothing happened.

It pressed again, held longer.

Still nothing.

Then the construct turned and placed John’s left wrist—band and all—against the plate.

The metal warmed.

The air pulsed.

The door opened.

John stepped through with his face blank and his mind razor-sharp.

Rows.

Shelves that climbed to the ceiling, packed with books and scrolls and bound folios. Not a few stacks in a wizard’s room—a true repository. The faint tower-glow was stronger here, held in the air like mist, but it didn’t feel oppressive. It felt… *filtered*. Shaped by the room’s geometry.

He didn’t gape. He didn’t pause.

He moved like a servant under watch.

The construct pointed toward a table near the entrance where several books were stacked. Then it pointed at John. Then at the stack.

Carry.

Of course.

Casil hadn’t given him the library out of kindness. He’d given him access because it was convenient for the tower to use his hands.

John picked up the top volume with his left hand and then added his right—awkwardly, deliberately, fingers lagging as if he couldn’t trust them.

He held the book against his chest.

The cover was plain. The title was stamped in a script he could read now—barely, painfully, but read.

Something like *Foundations of Circles and Flow*.

Not a spellbook with an obvious threat. A textbook. A manual.

John’s throat tightened, not from emotion—focus.

The construct pointed toward the shelves, toward a specific aisle.

Return these. Sort them.

A routine task.

A gift.

John walked the aisle and began placing books into their slots.

He moved slowly, making a show of caution. He tracked shelf labels in the same script, reading them in short bursts to avoid triggering a headache spike: *Circles*, *Aspects*, *Binding*, *Fields*, *History*.

Fields.

He remembered the shimmer-lines outside the tower, the grooves in the floor, the pressure-thump in the doors.

Everything here was field.

He returned the stack as instructed. He did not linger. He did not touch anything that looked like a locked volume. He did not run his fingers down spines like a curious child.

He acted like a tool.

The construct watched until the task was done, then gestured toward the exit.

John followed to the threshold.

The construct stepped out first.

The door remained open for a beat longer than usual.

Not long. Not an invitation.

Just… imperfect.

A servant’s door, not a master’s.

John felt the opportunity like a pulse.

He didn’t seize it immediately.

He moved to close the distance to the door as if simply following, then stopped at the table near the entrance and adjusted the stack of returned books by a fraction, aligning them.

A servant’s habit.

His fingers brushed the plain volume again—*Foundations of Circles and Flow*—and he let his eyes flick across the first page where the book had fallen open.

The script was dense but structured. Diagrams. Rings. Lines. Nodes.

He understood enough to know what it was trying to teach.

John looked up.

The construct had already turned down the corridor. It didn’t look back.

The door was still open.

John made a decision in the same way he’d made decisions under fire: fast, controlled, based on what the environment allowed.

He picked up the plain volume.

He carried it out with the other books.

If asked, it was part of the stack. A servant moving inventory.

If not asked, it was his first weapon.

Back in the study, he set the books down where the construct indicated. The plain volume sat among them without comment.

The constructs escorted him out of the study and returned him to his room.

The door sealed.

Silence.

John stood still until he was sure no construct was about to re-enter with another task.

Then he crossed the room, knelt, and slid his hand under the mattress to the knotted strip.

He added a knot.

Not for torture.

For access.

He lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling for one full breath, letting the pressure behind his teeth settle into its usual hum.

Then he reached into the fold of his blanket where he’d hidden the plain volume—carefully, quietly, like he was handling contraband.

He opened it.

The first paragraph hurt to read, not because of the content but because of the language imprint tugging at his brain each time he resolved a sentence. He adjusted, reading in short bursts, letting meaning settle between pulses of headache.

Circles weren’t decoration.

They were logic.

They were infrastructure for shaping the crowded pressure in the air—mana—into behavior. Flow, containment, direction, thresholds.

Rules.

John’s eyes moved over a diagram: a ring with a break, a line drawn outward, a second ring offset at an angle. Notes in the margin explained what happened when flow met a boundary, how pressure built, how it could be bled through a controlled gap.

A controlled gap.

A valve.

He stared at the diagram until his eyes watered from strain.

Then he read it again.

Not like a captive reading for comfort.

Like a soldier reading a manual in the field, memorizing the parts that kept him alive.

Outside, the tower’s pressure pressed at his teeth.

Inside, the book gave it names.

He turned the page.

And began to learn how to turn the tower’s rules into leverage.

---

**Change log (Scene 7):** Casil formally downgrades John from high-resource subject to servant due to “leakage”; John receives a function-mark band granting limited door recognition; servant duties give him mobility and mapping opportunities; he gains library entry as part of work, identifies permission mechanics, and quietly acquires a foundational circles/flow text—setting the hook for education and exploitation of tower rules.
