### Episode 2 — Scene 3: Drowning & Weight

On the third day—John thought it was the third; the tower didn’t give clocks—the constructs came for him before food.

He’d started measuring time by the ache behind his eyes.

When it was sharp enough to make him blink in involuntary bursts, it was soon after waking. When it dulled into a constant pressure, he could move without vomiting. When it flared again, he knew Casil was near, or the wards were about to open for him.

The pressure-thump hit.

The door opened.

No words. No ceremony. The lead construct pointed.

John stood and followed.

His body still carried the memory of fire: deep fatigue without visible injury, like he’d been forced through a furnace and left with only the aftertaste of heat. But he walked better than he should have. His balance was cleaner. His breathing was steadier. The tower’s crowded air pressed into him, and his skin prickled with it, like static on the edge of a storm.

He kept his face neutral and his hands visible.

He didn’t give anyone the satisfaction of seeing him test himself.

The lab was unchanged—circles carved into stone, grooves like veins, tables lined with tools and jars. But the center of the chamber was different.

A stone basin had been uncovered or rolled into place—oval, waist-high, deep enough to drown in. The water inside was dark, not from dirt but from depth, as if light couldn’t fully reach into it.

Casil stood beside it, calm, hands behind his back.

“You survived fire,” Casil said.

The words resolved with a sting behind John’s eyes. He didn’t answer.

Casil didn’t need answers. He needed reactions.

“Today,” Casil continued, “water.”

John’s throat tightened on instinct. Not fear—memory. Drowning drills, pool confidence tests, the body’s betrayals when oxygen disappears. He’d been trained to endure it.

He hadn’t been trained to endure it with something *else* pressing at the back of his teeth.

Casil gestured.

The lead construct guided John into the large circle again. Bands rose from the floor and wrapped his ankles and wrists with precise pressure. This time a collar formed too—cool metal around his neck, not choking, just present. A reminder of leverage.

Casil stayed outside the circle.

Always outside.

John noticed it every time. He couldn’t tell if it was a safety measure or part of the mechanism, but it meant Casil didn’t trust his own control to bring himself inside the boundary.

Casil lifted one hand.

The air shimmered faintly above his palm.

John felt the “hook” snap into place inside his chest again—same as fire, but colder. Like a coil tightening around his lungs.

Then the bands moved.

Not violently. Efficiently.

They pivoted his body forward and down toward the basin. His head angled over the water, close enough to feel the coolness rising off it.

John took one breath, deep and controlled, filling his lungs as if it mattered.

The bands lowered him.

His face broke the surface.

Cold wrapped his skin. Sound vanished into a muffled pressure. The water pressed against his eyes and nose and mouth with an intimacy that made the body panic.

John locked it down.

He held still, letting the first wave of instinct crash and pass.

Seconds ticked.

The water was not normal.

He felt it the way he felt the tower’s air—crowded, alive with pressure that wasn’t just liquid weight. It threaded around his skin and into his mouth, into his nostrils, into every place he tried to seal.

Not poison. Not burning.

Just *presence*.

His lungs began to demand air.

He refused them.

He kept counting the way he’d been trained to count under stress: simple numbers, steady rhythm, something to anchor the mind while the body screamed.

Ten. Fifteen. Twenty.

The urge to inhale climbed from discomfort into violence. His diaphragm spasmed. His throat tried to open.

John held.

Thirty.

The first involuntary inhale hit anyway—a sharp betrayal.

Water rushed in.

It wasn’t like swallowing. It was like being filled from the inside. Cold slammed down his throat and into his chest. His lungs seized, trying to cough with no air to cough into. Pain flared along the ribs.

His mind sharpened into a hard point.

*Not like this.*

The pull appeared again.

That same instinctive reach inside him, the same wrong valve opening—not toward air, not toward escape.

Toward the intrusion.

John leaned into it.

He didn’t “drink” the water. He didn’t “push” it out. He opened to the pressure threaded through it, and *took*.

The sensation was subtle at first, buried under drowning pain. Then it strengthened, the way a grip strengthens when it finds purchase.

The water still flooded his lungs.

But the panic shifted.

Not gone—never gone—but *redirected*. The urge to thrash became an urge to endure. The cold presence in the water felt like something he could grab, something he could hold inside him the way he’d held fire.

His chest burned in a new way, not heat but strain, like muscles working against a current.

He kept taking.

His lungs convulsed. He fought for control. He didn’t get it. He took anyway.

Time stretched.

His vision spotted at the edges.

He could feel the bands holding him at the basin’s lip, steady, patient. The tower’s method: let him break, don’t let him die. Learn from the line.

Just before his mind slipped—just before the black edge came in—he felt a shift in the water.

A tightening, like the basin had become a mouth.

Then release.

The bands jerked him up and back.

His face broke the surface.

Air hit him like a weapon. He sucked it in, choking, coughing, water pouring out of his mouth and nose. Pain tore through his chest and throat. He doubled forward against the restraints, trying to expel what didn’t belong.

He coughed blood into the basin.

For a moment he couldn’t see. His eyes streamed. The headache spiked into something that made his teeth ache.

Then his lungs forced a full breath in.

He didn’t collapse.

He hung there, shaking, saliva and water dripping from his jaw.

Casil watched him like he was watching a flame change color.

“You took it,” Casil said quietly.

John dragged air in through his nose. It hurt. It worked.

Casil’s eyes tracked minute movements in John’s chest. “Most drown,” Casil continued. “They fight. Their bodies reject. They rupture. You… consume.”

Consume. Absorb. Same concept, different word.

John lifted his head slowly and met Casil’s eyes.

He said nothing.

Silence was cheaper than speech.

Casil made a small motion with his hand.

The collar at John’s neck cooled again, and the ache in his lungs eased—not healed, not erased, just reduced, like someone had loosened a fist. John felt the change inside him too: the water in his lungs didn’t feel as present anymore. Not because it was gone, but because what mattered in it had been stripped.

He understood without fully understanding.

He wasn’t absorbing *water*.

He was absorbing whatever pressure threaded through it.

Aspect.

Density.

Mechanisms he didn’t have language for yet, but could feel in his bones.

Casil gestured toward a table.

The bands guided John out of the circle and released him in sequence. He stumbled once, caught himself with his left hand, and stood upright. His right hand twitched uselessly near his side.

A construct held out a cloth.

John took it with his left hand and wiped his face. His tongue sting reminded him the bite wound hadn’t fully healed. He swallowed and felt a scraping pain deep in his chest—raw tissue, inflamed from water intrusion.

He should have been crippled.

He wasn’t.

Casil’s voice cut in. “Walk.”

John walked.

A slow circuit of the lab, under Casil’s eyes. Each step was a test: coordination, dizziness, collapse risk. John kept his pace steady and his breathing as controlled as it could be with shredded lungs.

By the time he finished the circuit, he realized something else.

The tower’s air—mana-rich, crowded—was pressing into him harder now.

Not because the air had changed.

Because he had space for it.

He’d taken something in the basin. He could feel the absence of it now, like an empty socket that wanted filling. The tower’s ambient pressure was eager to occupy it.

His skin prickled again.

He didn’t pull.

Not yet.

Not in front of Casil.

Casil nodded once, satisfied. “Return.”

John followed the constructs back through the corridors, chest aching, throat raw. He tasted blood at the back of his tongue and didn’t spit. He couldn’t afford theatrics; he couldn’t afford to give Casil a dramatic baseline.

Back in his room, the door sealed.

Food arrived later. John stared at it for a long time, not because he thought it was poisoned, but because his body felt both exhausted and *hungry* in a deeper way.

He ate anyway.

Afterward he lay on the bed and closed his eyes, focusing on his breathing.

Each inhale scraped. Each exhale rattled.

He should have been drowning in his own fluid.

Instead, he could feel his body doing something unnatural.

Repairing.

Not by rest alone. Not by sleep.

By pulling on the tower’s crowded air.

He tested it carefully.

He opened the smallest valve inside him, the one he’d found in the fire test and used in the basin.

A thread of pressure slid into him.

It wasn’t warm. It wasn’t cold. It was like drinking from a stream you couldn’t see.

His headache flared once, hard, then steadied.

His lungs loosened by degrees. The raw scrape softened into a bruised ache. He could take a deeper breath without coughing blood.

He stopped.

He didn’t know the limits. He didn’t know what “too much” did. He only knew “some” worked.

He slept.

When he woke, his chest still hurt—but it worked.

That was the line.

The next session came without warning.

Same escort. Same lab.

Different centerpiece.

A stone platform within the circle, slightly raised. Above it, nothing visible—no beams, no hooks. But the grooves in the floor were denser here, braided into a pattern that made the air feel taut.

Casil stood beside the platform and watched John enter the circle.

Bands wrapped ankles and wrists again. This time they pulled his arms slightly outward, not crucified, but spread enough that his chest was open.

Casil lifted a hand.

John felt the hook snap into place.

Then the weight arrived.

Not a physical object.

A force.

It pressed down on John’s shoulders and spine as if the tower had decided gravity was negotiable and chose to renegotiate it.

John’s knees bent involuntarily.

He gritted his teeth and straightened them.

The weight increased.

His bones complained. His muscles trembled. Breath became work.

The platform under his feet felt like it was sinking, though it wasn’t. It was his body compressing under load, joints stacking tighter, ribs squeezing inward.

Casil watched, face calm.

“You will not die,” Casil said. “Unless you insist.”

The words landed with a sting behind John’s eyes. John didn’t answer. He focused on posture. He kept his spine aligned. He pushed his shoulders back and down, trying to keep his ribcage from collapsing into itself.

The weight climbed again.

A sharp pain flared along his left knee. His right wrist restraint bit into numb skin.

His vision narrowed.

He could feel the tower’s crowded air pressing harder now, as if the increased load had made him more permeable.

His body wanted to panic.

He refused.

He opened the valve.

The weight didn’t stop. It didn’t disappear.

But as he took the pressure threaded through it—whatever “earth” meant in this system—the load changed character.

It still crushed him.

But the crushing became… useful.

Like training under a bar you never chose, building muscle whether you wanted it or not.

His legs shook violently. His core locked tight. Sweat ran down his temples and into his eyes.

He kept taking.

His ribs flexed under pressure and didn’t snap.

His spine compressed and held.

He felt something inside him thicken—not flesh exactly, but the sense of *structure* being reinforced. Like his body was being taught a new baseline for “normal.”

His breathing stayed harsh, but it stayed possible.

Casil’s gaze sharpened slightly.

John didn’t let it show that he’d found a foothold.

He held.

Time became simple: endure the next second, then the next.

His muscles screamed. His joints begged. His heart hammered hard enough to shake his vision.

Still he held.

When his body reached the edge of failure—when his legs began to fold and his chest threatened to collapse—Casil made a small motion with his fingers.

The weight eased.

Not all at once. Gradual. Controlled.

John didn’t fall. He straightened as the load reduced, keeping his knees unlocked, keeping blood moving. He breathed through clenched teeth and waited for the next blow.

It didn’t come.

The bands released.

John stepped off the platform with careful precision and stood upright by will alone. His legs trembled like they were made of wire.

Casil watched him breathe.

“You adapt quickly,” Casil said.

John made himself meet Casil’s eyes.

He could have spoken. He could have thrown a line back. He could have asked a question.

He didn’t.

Speech had a cost, and Casil paid nothing for it.

Casil turned away as if John was already categorized. “Return.”

John walked back to his room on legs that felt heavier than they should.

Halfway through the corridor, he realized his balance wasn’t worse.

It was better.

He felt planted in a way he hadn’t since before capture. Like his body had decided the floor was an ally instead of a surface.

Back in his room, the door sealed.

John sat on the bed and stared at his hands.

Left hand: steady.

Right hand: still numb, still unreliable—but when he flexed his fingers, they responded with a slightly cleaner delay, less lag between intention and movement. The improvement was small, but it was real.

He closed his eyes and focused on his breathing.

He opened the valve again, taking a thread of the tower’s crowded air into himself.

The ache in his legs shifted. The shaking eased. The deep strain in his spine softened into something like soreness after hard training.

Not rest.

Repair.

He stopped before greed took over.

He leaned back against the stone wall and stared at the ceiling.

Two tests.

Two survivals.

Two lessons.

One: pain was information here, not just damage.

Two: his recovery wasn’t passive. The tower fed him whether he wanted it to or not—if he knew how to accept it.

He needed a framework.

Not magic theory yet. Not words he didn’t have.

Just a way to measure what they were doing to him and what it was doing back.

He sat up, took the edge of the blanket, and tore a narrow strip with his left hand.

He tied knots into it—simple, tight, evenly spaced. One knot per session.

A crude tally.

The tower could keep its clocks.

John would keep his own.

He set the knotted strip under the mattress where it wouldn’t be obvious.

Then he lay back down and listened to the crowded air press against his teeth.

He counted breaths.

And he counted what they did to him.

Not like a prisoner waiting.

Like a soldier building a training schedule.
