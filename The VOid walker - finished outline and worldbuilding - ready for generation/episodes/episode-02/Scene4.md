### Episode 2 — Scene 4: Edges & Darkness

By the time Casil brought wind, John had stopped pretending the sessions were spaced evenly.

The tower didn’t care about sleep cycles. It didn’t care about meals. It didn’t care about what a human body could “take” on paper. The constructs came when the wards opened for them, and John learned the pattern the way he learned any hostile schedule: by watching what stayed consistent.

The circle was always waiting.

Casil was always outside it.

And the air was always too close.

John’s knot-strip grew under the mattress—one knot per session, tight and even. He stopped counting days. He counted exposures.

When the door opened, he was already standing.

The lead construct pointed.

John walked.

His chest no longer rattled from the drowning test, but he still felt it if he breathed too deep too fast—rawness that flared, then settled. His legs carried weight better than they had any right to. The tower’s crowded pressure pressed into him and didn’t just annoy his teeth anymore. It felt like something that wanted *entry*.

He didn’t give it much.

Not here.

Not while Casil watched.

The lab’s center had been cleared. No basin. No platform. Just the circle and a low stone post at its edge with a row of metal pins set into it like pegs.

Casil’s eyes tracked John’s approach.

“Today,” Casil said, “edges.”

The word resolved with a stab behind John’s eyes. He held his face still.

Bands rose from the floor and wrapped John’s ankles and wrists. This time they left his arms free enough to move within a small range—enough to flinch, enough to fail, not enough to reach anything outside the circle.

Casil lifted one hand.

John felt the hook set in his chest.

The air in front of him hardened.

Not visibly. Not like a wall. Like a direction suddenly had weight.

Then the first cut landed.

A line of pain opened across his left forearm, perfectly straight, as if something had drawn a blade through the air and his skin had agreed to part. Blood welled immediately.

John’s body tried to jerk away.

He locked it down.

Second cut—across the right bicep, higher up. Pain bloomed, sharp and clean. The numb right hand didn’t register it properly at the fingertips, but the arm did. He felt the tug of muscle fibers and the warmth of blood.

Third—across the ribs. Not deep enough to open the chest, deep enough to hurt like it meant it.

Wind.

Not gusts. Not pressure. An edge moving through the space between Casil’s hand and John’s skin.

John took a controlled breath through his nose and tasted iron.

The next cut came at his cheek.

It stung like a slap and bled down toward his jaw. His bite wound protested when he swallowed.

Casil watched without blinking.

John watched back.

He focused on the moment between cuts—the half-second where the air tensed right before the edge arrived. He couldn’t see it, but he could feel the crowded pressure align, like a thread being pulled taut.

The next edge came.

John leaned into the pull inside him—small, deliberate.

He *took*.

The cut still opened. The pain still hit. But the edge didn’t carry through the same way. It felt blunter at the end, like the force behind it had been thinned.

He didn’t stop the injury.

He reduced the *waste*.

Blood ran down his forearms. The tower’s ambient pressure pressed at the wounds, eager.

John took only what he needed to keep his head clear.

Casil’s eyes sharpened slightly.

He adjusted his hand.

The edges came faster.

Forearm. Shoulder. Thigh. A thin line across the back of his left hand, and John’s fingers twitched involuntarily.

He didn’t scream. He didn’t beg. He didn’t bargain.

He stood in the circle and let his skin be turned into a map.

The pain tried to climb into panic, and John stepped around it the way he’d stepped around fear in other places: by turning it into data.

Angle. Timing. Depth. Cadence.

When the edges slowed, he saw what Casil was doing.

Not random cuts. Pattern.

The lines weren’t scattered. They were placed to test response: high blood flow, low blood flow, nerve-rich zones, muscle, tendon.

Casil wasn’t hurting him to hurt him.

Casil was building a profile.

John kept his breathing steady.

The last edge landed across the inside of his right wrist.

His numb hand spasmed. For a second sensation flared—bright and wrong—then dropped back into deadened channels. It wasn’t healing yet. But the border of numbness felt… narrower. Like the cut had traced the edge and his body had taken note.

The hook in his chest loosened.

The air softened.

Casil’s hand lowered.

John was still bleeding.

He expected a release. A gesture. A command.

Instead, Casil said, “Hold.”

The bands tightened a fraction, keeping him upright.

John realized what “hold” meant when he felt the tower’s crowded pressure begin to press into the open wounds.

Not like infection. Not like poison.

Like fuel finding a seam.

His skin prickled around each cut. Heat wasn’t the right word. It was a sensation of *joining*, as if the torn edges wanted to knit and the air itself was offering thread.

John kept his face still.

Inside, he opened the valve a notch.

He took.

The pressure slid into him through the wounds like water through a crack—fast, eager.

The cuts began to close.

Not instantly. Not cleanly. But visibly, by degrees. Blood slowed. Pain changed from sharp line to deep ache.

Casil watched the closure rate with focus that bordered on satisfaction.

“Wind does not repel,” Casil murmured, almost to himself. “Light does not repel. Dark does not repel.”

John heard the words and paid the price behind his eyes for understanding them.

Not repel.

Not reject.

No filter.

He had absorbed fire. Water. Weight. Wind.

And none of them had turned his body against him.

That should have been relief.

It wasn’t.

Because with each intake, the crowded pressure in the tower felt less like a weather condition and more like a tide that wanted to fill him until he split.

Casil gestured.

The bands released.

John didn’t move at first. He tested his limbs. The cuts were mostly sealed—thin pink lines where flesh had been opened. His hands trembled with aftershock, but they worked. The right hand still lagged behind intention, but the lag was improving in millimeters.

Casil didn’t give him time to process.

He turned toward another circle at the far end of the lab—smaller, tighter. The grooves around it were denser, layered, like someone had carved the same line over and over until the stone remembered it.

A construct guided John to it.

Bands rose again—wrists and ankles, and this time a band at his forehead, cold against skin, keeping his head facing forward.

Casil raised his hand.

John felt the hook snap into place.

Then the light hit.

It wasn’t a torch flare. It wasn’t a beam he could track. It was like the space in front of his eyes became pure brightness.

His pupils tried to clamp down and couldn’t fast enough. Pain lanced through his skull. The headache behind his eyes spiked into something that made his teeth hurt.

His vision washed out into white.

No edges. No depth. No distance. Just overwhelming presence.

John’s body responded with involuntary recoil—muscles tightening, breath catching.

He forced breath in through his nose and out through clenched teeth.

He tried to close his eyes.

The band at his forehead held his head steady, and the brightness wasn’t just visual. It felt like it was *inside* his skull, pouring through him.

He tasted copper again.

A nosebleed started and he didn’t notice until warmth ran down his upper lip.

John refused to flail. He refused to give Casil a panic response to record.

He leaned into the valve.

He took.

The brightness didn’t dim the way wind had. It didn’t blunt at the edges.

But the pain shifted.

Instead of burning outward, it became pressure he could hold. Like being forced to stare into the sun and realizing the glare could be swallowed—if you were willing to pay for it.

His stomach tightened. His skin felt too tight. His heartbeat thumped hard enough to make the white shimmer.

He kept taking anyway because the alternative was blacking out, and blacking out meant losing control of what they did next.

Casil adjusted.

The light *intensified*.

John’s vision went from white to something like layered white—thicker, denser. His eyes watered until tears ran down his face.

He didn’t scream.

His jaw clenched so hard his teeth ached.

Then, as abruptly as it began, the light cut off.

The absence hit him like a slap.

His eyes kept firing, seeing brightness that wasn’t there. Afterimages crawled across his vision—ghost shapes that had no source. The headache throbbed.

John sucked air in and held it for a count of three, forcing his body to reset.

Casil said, “Do you see?”

John blinked fast, trying to clear the washout.

“I see,” he rasped.

Speech cost him. It drove a spike into the bruise behind his eyes.

Casil’s gaze stayed on him. “And yet you did not collapse.”

John didn’t answer.

Casil’s hand moved again.

The bands at John’s wrists and ankles tightened. The circle’s held-breath feeling returned.

Then the world went dark.

Not dim.

Not “lights out.”

Dark as a sealed lid.

John’s vision became nothing. Not even the faint glow he’d gotten used to in the tower. His eyes, still raw from the light, tried to find an edge and found only absence.

Sound changed too. The lab’s quiet became a vacuum. The faint hiss of ambient air vanished. Even his own breathing sounded distant, like it belonged to someone else.

The pressure behind his teeth became his only anchor.

John swallowed and tasted blood from his nose.

The darkness wasn’t just lack of light.

It was *presence*, the same way the water had been presence, the same way the tower air was presence. It pressed against him from all sides, heavy and intimate.

His body didn’t know what to do with it.

His mind did.

He counted.

One. Two. Three.

He listened to his own pulse. He felt the bands on his wrists, the cool metal at his skin. He pushed his tongue against the bite wound to make sure pain existed and he was still inside himself.

Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

The darkness pressed harder.

Something in him wanted to reach outward—not to take, but to *push it away*. To create distance.

John tried.

A reflexive shove.

The result was immediate backlash—pain in his skull, sharp and punishing, like the tower slapped his brain for the attempt.

He stopped.

So. Not push.

Take.

He opened the valve again.

He took the dark.

The sensation was wrong. Fire had been agony. Water had been suffocation. Weight had been crushing. Wind had been slicing. Light had been overload.

Dark was *pressure without direction*.

It slid into him like cold oil.

His stomach tightened. His skin prickled. The headache pulsed.

But the darkness in the space around him—whatever construct Casil was using to create this sealed absence—thinned at the edges. Not enough to see. Enough to feel that taking it mattered.

John kept taking.

He didn’t know how long it lasted.

Time in the dark wasn’t time. It was endurance.

At some point his breathing steadied. The panic edge dulled. The sensation of being pressed into nothingness became something he could hold.

And with that came the problem he’d been trying not to name.

He felt *full*.

Not stomach-full.

Full like a container filled past the point of comfort.

His chest felt tight. His skin felt stretched. The crowded pressure behind his teeth swelled until it made his gums ache.

His heart thumped hard and heavy.

His hands tingled—not the right hand’s numbness, but an underlying vibration, like his nerves were being used as wires.

He kept taking anyway because stopping meant the dark would crush back in.

When the hook finally released, it hit him like relief and like threat at the same time.

Sound returned in a rush. The lab’s air hissed back into his ears. The faint ambient glow returned—too bright after the dark, too dim after the light.

John blinked hard. Tears ran down his face. His nose still bled slowly.

The bands released.

He didn’t fall. But he swayed.

Casil watched him with the calm attention of someone watching a dam hold under rising water.

“No rejection,” Casil said quietly.

John heard it, and the meaning stabbed behind his eyes.

Casil stepped closer—still outside the circle boundaries, but close enough that John could see the fine stitched lines in his robe, the way they shifted when he breathed.

“You accept all aspects,” Casil continued. “You ingest what should destroy you. That is your function.”

Function.

John wiped his nose with the back of his left wrist and smeared blood across healing cuts.

Casil didn’t react to the mess.

He gestured once.

A construct came forward with a clay cup.

John took it and drank because his mouth felt like sand. The water vibrated faintly, alive with pressure.

His body wanted to drink it all.

He stopped himself after two swallows.

Casil watched that too.

“Return,” Casil said.

John turned and walked out under escort.

The corridors were the same. The stone was the same. The carved grooves caught the same faint glow.

But John’s relationship to the tower’s air had changed again.

It wasn’t just crowded.

It was hungry.

Or he was.

Every breath felt like it carried weight into him. The pressure behind his teeth pulsed with each inhale. His skin felt tight across his forearms, his neck, his chest.

By the time he reached his room, his head was throbbing.

The door sealed.

Silence.

John stood in the center of the room and didn’t move.

He focused inward.

He could feel what he’d taken. Not as separate elements he could label, but as a mass inside him—heat memory, cold pressure, weight, edge, brightness, absence. All sitting under his skin like coiled rope.

His body was using some of it to repair—he could feel that in the way his lungs were clearer, his legs steadier, his wounds sealed clean.

But not all of it.

There was more than he needed.

And it wasn’t leaving.

He tried the simplest thing.

He opened the valve the other way—just a fraction—trying to let excess *bleed out*.

Nothing.

No release. No easing.

He tried again, slightly harder.

A sharp spike of pain punched through his skull and made his vision flash.

He stopped, breathing shallow until the pain passed.

Okay.

So intake was easy. Output was punished.

A one-way system.

John sat on the bed and pressed his palms against his thighs, forcing himself to hold still. He stared at the stone wall until his breathing steadied.

His right hand twitched.

He flexed the fingers. The lag was smaller. The numbness felt less like a dead wall and more like a fog you could push through.

Progress.

And a trap.

Because if every aspect fed him, then Casil could “train” him by hurting him, and the tower would keep him alive long enough to do it again.

And if he couldn’t release what he took—

He pictured a container filling under steady pour, no drain. Eventually it cracks. Eventually it bursts. It doesn’t matter how thick the walls are if the pressure never stops.

His mouth went dry again.

He took two slow breaths and felt the tower’s ambient pressure slide into him on its own, like it didn’t need permission anymore.

He clenched his jaw until his teeth ached.

This wasn’t just torture.

This was accumulation.

He lay back and stared at the ceiling.

Sleep came in short chunks. Each time he drifted off, he woke with the same sensation: skin too tight, air too close, head pounding.

At some point, in the deepest part of night—or what passed for it—he sat up and swung his legs off the bed.

He stood, unsteady.

He paced the room once, then twice.

Movement helped. Not because it released anything, but because it made his body *use* a fraction more. The pressure behind his teeth eased by a hair when his muscles worked.

He stopped by the door plate and placed his left palm against it, not to open it, but to steady himself.

The door refused him, silent and absolute.

John closed his eyes.

Survive. Learn rules. Turn rules into leverage.

He had learned a rule tonight.

He could take anything Casil threw at him.

And the tower would keep feeding him whether he wanted it or not.

If he kept taking without a way to vent, he wouldn’t die quickly.

He would die *eventually*, violently, from inside his own advantage.

He pulled his hand away from the door and returned to the bed.

He reached under the mattress and touched the knotted strip, fingers moving over the knots like a rosary.

Not a prayer.

A tally of what he’d endured and what it had done to him.

He added one more knot with his left hand, tight and exact.

Then he lay back and stared at the stone ceiling until his eyes burned.

Tomorrow—whenever the tower decided it was tomorrow—he would need to solve the one-way problem.

Because endurance wasn’t enough.

Not if the win condition was rupture.
