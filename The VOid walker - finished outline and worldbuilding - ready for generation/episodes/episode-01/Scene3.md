The first thing John noticed was that gravity lied here.

The shuttle—if it could be called that—dropped out of whatever passage it used and the weight in his bones turned soft for a heartbeat, like the planet below had forgotten to pull. His stomach rose, his teeth ached, and then the pull came back harder than before, snapping his organs into place.

The men around him grunted and swayed. Chains clinked. Someone gagged.

John kept his balance by widening his stance and bending his knees the way he would on a ship taking fire. He didn’t fight the motion. Fighting wasted energy. Fighting got you singled out.

The compartment smelled of old sweat and metal and a sweet rot that clung to the back of his throat. His right hand hung uselessly at the end of his arm, fingers numb. The injury had settled into a steady ache with flashes of bright pain when he moved wrong.

A latch thumped somewhere above them. Light bled in through cracks.

Not the clean white of Alliance fixtures.

This light was tinted, as if it had to push through something thick to exist.

The pressure behind John’s teeth returned as the doors opened fully. The air outside hit him like a hand on the face—warm, heavy, and *charged* in a way he couldn’t name. His skin prickled. His stomach rolled.

Mana. Or whatever the hell it was.

He didn’t think the word. He didn’t have the word yet.

He only had the feeling: the environment itself was hostile, not by temperature or toxins, but by presence.

“Move,” a guard said—meaningless syllables, but the tone was universal.

A prod tapped John’s shoulder blade. Not hard. Just enough to tell him where his boundaries were.

He stepped forward with the rest.

They filed down a ramp onto a platform of dark stone that looked too smooth, too perfect. There were no rivets. No weld seams. No maintenance marks. The surface had been made, not built.

John lifted his eyes.

The sky above the landing field was a pale, bruised color. Not a clean blue. Not storm. Just… different. The horizon was crowded with structures that didn’t look like any human city he’d seen. Towers and arches that leaned into shapes with no obvious support, held by repeating patterns carved into their surfaces—geometry doing the work of steel.

And above it all, ships drifted.

Not jets. Not shuttles. Not anything with visible thrust.

They hung in the air like predators that didn’t need to flap. Some were sleek and dark. Some looked like floating barges. A few were simply *shapes*—too large to be believable, moving slowly, silently, their shadows sliding across the ground like a slow eclipse.

John’s breath caught despite himself.

He forced it back to steady.

He didn’t stare. Staring was a tell. Staring made you look like prey.

They marched him through a corridor of stone pylons toward the market complex. The soundscape thickened with each step: voices in unfamiliar languages, the ring of metal, the bark of orders, the low moan of beasts that weren’t beasts.

The smell got worse.

Spice and incense layered over piss and blood. Perfume trying to drown rot and failing.

Guards flanked the group. Not just the merchant crew that had carried them here—others joined, wearing different colors, different insignia, different posture. Some moved like bored workers. Some moved like soldiers. Some moved like men who enjoyed their job too much.

John watched their hands.

No guns. No holsters. No obvious tech. A few carried blades that glinted wrong, like the edge didn’t quite match the light. A few wore shiny rings.

A man near the front stumbled. The guard nearest him raised a hand—

—and the air *shifted*. Not wind. Not pressure. A sudden tightening that made John’s ears pop and his stomach clench.

The stumbling man froze mid-fall, caught in place like someone had grabbed him by the spine. He righted himself, shaking, and kept moving.

No one spoke about it.

John filed that away.

Control here didn’t come from weapons. It came from the environment, from rules he didn’t know, enforced by people who did.

They entered the market through a gate that looked like carved bone. The inside was worse than the outside.

Pens stretched in rows, stacked and layered like a stadium built for suffering. Cages, pits, chain loops in the floor. Platforms where buyers could walk past and look down like they were admiring livestock.

And the stock wasn’t just human.

A creature with four arms sat hunched in one pen, its skin mottled and slick, its eyes hidden under a ridge of cartilage. Another pen held something small and furred with a muzzle full of flat teeth—herbivore teeth—but it watched the guards with cold intelligence. A tall, thin figure with skin like pale bark stood perfectly still as people passed, its chest rising so slowly John had to stare to confirm it breathed.

There were more. Too many.

A galaxy’s worth of bodies, arranged by value.

John’s nausea returned, but it wasn’t only the air. It was the order of it. The efficiency. The casual cruelty made into architecture.

He looked for exits.

There were three obvious gates on the far side of the pen complex. Two raised platforms with guard concentrations. A central tower where clerks moved in and out carrying slate-like objects and bundles of sealed documents.

No cameras. No drones. No obvious sensors.

But the air itself felt watched.

Like the space between his skin and the world had eyes.

His group was shoved into a holding pen marked with a symbol painted in dark red. The guards latched the gate and stepped back.

John assessed quickly.

Pen walls: stone waist-high, topped with metal spikes. Not to keep them in—spikes didn’t stop a desperate man—but to punish climbing and make the buyers feel safe.

Floor: packed dirt mixed with straw. Straw meant long-term use. This place wasn’t a temporary dump. It was a business.

The pressure in the air made his head throb. It wasn’t a sharp pain. It was steady, like a hand pressing down on his brain.

He shifted his weight, found a spot where the ache was slightly less. The effect wasn’t uniform. There were gradients in the wrongness, like invisible currents.

So it wasn’t “air.” It was something *in* the air, moving with its own rules.

John kept his face blank and his posture controlled.

That mattered. Even here. Especially here.

A man to his left leaned close enough that John could smell his breath—stale, nervous.

Human. Older than John, with a hollow look and a bruise blooming under one eye. He didn’t speak loudly. He didn’t risk drawing attention.

“Where… where are we?” the man whispered.

John didn’t answer at first. Answering felt like admitting they were real.

Then he gave the only truth he had. “A market.”

The man’s eyes flicked around, taking in the pens and the non-humans and the drifting ships visible through the open canopy above.

He swallowed hard. “We— we can’t—”

John cut him off with a low, flat tone. “Breathe slow.”

It wasn’t comfort. It was control. It was the only kindness John could afford without breaking himself.

The man nodded once, like a soldier taking an order, and backed away.

John watched the crowd beyond the pen.

Buyers moved through the aisles in small groups. Wealthy ones didn’t walk like the guards. They didn’t hurry. They owned the space. They spoke, gestured, laughed. A few carried servants who held parasols that shimmered faintly, as if the air around them resisted dust.

Clerks stood at stations with stacks of thin slate and styluses. Not data pads. Not screens. The slate surfaces looked like polished stone, and when a clerk touched a corner, faint lines glowed for a moment and then faded.

Low tech. Or no tech.

It didn’t fit with ships floating in the sky.

John tried to reconcile it the way he always did: look for the system.

The system here didn’t use engines and processors. It used patterns. Symbols. Formations carved into stone and worn like jewelry. Whatever powered the ships and the gates and the “freeze a man mid-fall” trick wasn’t electricity.

It was something woven into the world.

Above a certain complexity, human tech required stable rules: predictable signals, predictable materials, predictable physics. Here, the rules felt… *crowded*. Like there was an extra layer between cause and effect.

John didn’t have the language for it, but his instincts recognized the outcome:

This place wasn’t built for machines.

It was built for *something else*.

A shadow passed over the pen. John looked up.

A large ship drifted overhead, low enough that he could see its underside—smooth plates, no exhaust, no turbines, just faint lines carved in repeating curves. The lines shimmered like heat haze, but the air wasn’t hot. The ship moved without sound for a second, then a delayed low thrumming arrived as if the sound had to decide to exist.

John’s stomach tightened.

He tore his eyes away and forced himself to focus on what mattered.

People.

Money.

Power.

The market ran on those everywhere.

Guards opened another pen across the aisle and dragged out a creature that looked like a lizard standing upright, its skin iridescent. It fought. The guards didn’t strike it. One of them tapped a ring against the creature’s forehead.

The creature went limp instantly, eyes rolling back.

The guards carried it away like a sack.

No struggle. No blood. Pure control.

John watched the guards’ rings carefully.

The ring stones were the same wet-looking material he’d noticed earlier.

If those rings were keys, then the guards weren’t strong. They were authorized.

That meant authority could be stolen.

Not now. Not without language. Not without tools. But the concept lodged in John’s mind like a nail.

They kept them in the pen for what could have been hours.

The sun—if it was a sun—didn’t move the way John expected. Light shifted, but not along a clean arc. It brightened and dimmed in slow pulses, like the sky breathed.

His head throbbed steadily. His right arm ached. His mouth was dry.

He rationed his saliva. He kept his breathing slow. He didn’t lean on the wall where buyers could see him weak.

Then the handlers came.

They didn’t use whips. They didn’t need to.

They opened the pen gate and pointed. Four humans were pulled out first. Two men, two women. Younger. Healthier. Less injured.

John watched where they were taken: to a washing station where attendants poured water over them, scrubbed them, cut away filthy fabric, replaced it with simple cloth. They didn’t care about comfort. They cared about appearance.

Inventory prep.

John didn’t move until a guard grabbed his chain and yanked.

Pain flashed in his right shoulder. He kept his face calm.

He walked where they pulled him.

The washing station was a long trough of stone with drains carved into it. Water poured from spouts shaped like animal mouths. The water smelled faintly of minerals and something sharp. It made John’s skin prickle more than it already did.

Attendants scrubbed him with rough cloth. They cleaned blood from his knuckles and dried sweat from his neck. They didn’t ask permission. They didn’t speak to him like a person.

One of them touched his right hand and frowned at the numb fingers. He prodded the forearm, then stepped back and called a guard.

A different attendant arrived—a woman, maybe, from body shape. She wore gloves and a small pendant that glowed faintly when she leaned close to John’s arm.

She held the pendant near his skin.

John felt cold pressure slide into his nerves like a knife dipped in ice.

He swallowed hard and kept his posture steady.

The attendant tilted her head, as if listening to something inside him, then made a small sign with her fingers. The pendant’s glow dimmed.

She spoke to the guard.

John didn’t understand the words, but he recognized the tone: diagnosis. Value assessment.

The guard nodded and tugged John’s chain again.

They dressed him in plain cloth that covered bruises but didn’t hide his build. They left his injuries visible enough to explain, not enough to lower the price too far.

That told John something else.

They weren’t just selling bodies. They were selling *stories*: what you were, where you came from, why you mattered.

Humans mattered.

He was marched to a staging area behind the auction floor.

The floor itself was a wide platform surrounded by ascending steps where buyers sat or stood. Not a single unified crowd, but clusters—merchant families with guards behind them, solitary figures in expensive robes, groups of scholars with tablets and sharp eyes.

At the center of the platform, a stone post stood with chain hooks.

John’s chain was clipped to the post.

The hook clicked, and he felt the weight settle. He tested the chain lightly.

Strong. Short.

He could step forward, turn, stand tall.

He couldn’t lunge.

A handler stepped in front of him and barked a phrase. John didn’t move.

The handler raised a hand as if to slap him, then hesitated—looked to the side, to someone higher up.

Permission was required even for violence.

The handler lowered his hand and instead grabbed John’s chin, forcing his head up toward the crowd.

John’s jaw tightened. He didn’t fight. Fighting made bruises. Bruises lowered price. Lower price meant worse owner.

He chose the only leverage available:

He made himself look *useful*.

He stood straight. Shoulders back. Eyes forward. Expression calm. Not submissive, not defiant. Controlled.

He let them see muscle and discipline.

A low murmur ran through the crowd. Not awe. Interest.

An auctioneer stepped to the front—tall, wearing layered cloth and a collar piece that shimmered faintly. The auctioneer held a small rod, polished, carved with repeating symbols.

The rod tapped the stone platform once.

The sound was too loud.

It rang out in a way that made John’s teeth ache, as if the vibration reached into bone.

The auctioneer spoke.

Words spilled out in a language John couldn’t parse, but the cadence was practiced. Sales pitch. Items listed. Terms and conditions. A few words repeated multiple times, and each repetition made parts of the crowd lean forward.

One of the repeated terms was paired with a gesture: the auctioneer’s hand made a sweeping motion outward, like indicating distance or emptiness.

Dead space.

Dead zone.

John didn’t know the phrase. He felt the meaning anyway.

The crowd’s interest sharpened when the auctioneer gestured at John, then gestured outward, as if saying: *from far away*.

Another repeated term came with a touch of the rod to John’s chest.

John felt a faint pressure through the fabric, like the rod’s symbols tried to bite into him and slid off.

A small ripple of reaction ran through the closest buyers—surprise, curiosity, a hint of disappointment.

The auctioneer’s tone shifted, becoming more animated.

John understood the shape of the pitch:

Rare. Foreign. Unusual.

And something about him resisted their normal tools.

That made him more valuable, not less.

A buyer stood, a slender figure in a deep blue robe. The figure raised two fingers.

The auctioneer responded immediately, voice rising, and tapped the rod again.

Another buyer raised a hand. Then another.

Bidding.

John couldn’t track numbers. He didn’t need to. He tracked *behavior*.

When the bids were low, people moved casually. When the bids rose, guards leaned in. Servants whispered. Hands tightened on railings. A scholar in a pale coat began to speak fast to the robed buyer, eyes shining with an excitement that made John’s skin crawl.

Not greed.

Curiosity.

The kind of curiosity that cut things open to see what was inside.

John held his posture steady and let his mind work.

If a scholar bought him, he’d be an experiment.

If a noble bought him, he’d be a trophy.

If a merchant bought him, he’d be an asset—used, traded, gifted.

None were good.

But one category was survivable.

Assets were kept intact.

Experiments were not.

John’s eyes swept the crowd, looking for the buyer who treated this like business instead of wonder.

He found him on the second tier, slightly elevated, surrounded by three guards and two attendants. The man—human? no. Close enough to read as humanoid, with pale skin and dark hair pulled back—wore simple clothing that still looked expensive because it was clean and fitted and carried a quiet authority.

He didn’t lean forward.

He didn’t smile.

He watched John like an officer reads a casualty list

He raised a hand once, minimal motion, and an attendant beside him spoke softly to a clerk.

A bid was called.

The auctioneer’s head turned toward him with respect.

Status.

Money.

Real power.

Other bidders responded. The blue-robed figure raised fingers again, sharper now. A group of scholars huddled, whispered, then one of them raised a hand with enthusiasm that looked like hunger.

John felt the pressure behind his teeth spike.

The air seemed to thicken as if the room itself reacted to rising stakes. Or maybe he was just getting sicker from the environment.

He didn’t let it show.

A handler stepped behind him and pushed his shoulder, turning him slowly so the crowd could see his profile, his back, his build.

John allowed it, controlling the movement so he didn’t look handled.

He saw movement at the edge of the platform: another human being led up, head down, trembling. The crowd barely looked. The interest stayed on John.

Rare.

He kept that word in his head, like a blade.

A buyer from the lower tier stood—short, heavy, wearing jewelry that glittered. He shouted something and jabbed a finger upward.

The crowd laughed. The auctioneer laughed with them.

Not a serious bidder. Posturing.

Good. Let them waste oxygen.

The serious bidders stayed quiet.

The merchant raised his hand again, the same minimal motion. Another bid.

The blue-robed figure hesitated. The scholars whispered more urgently, then their leader raised a hand with three fingers.

The auctioneer’s voice climbed, and the rod tapped the stone again.

The sound hit John’s teeth like a hammer.

His right arm pain flared with it, like the resonance found the nerve injury and played it.

He kept breathing slow.

He didn’t look at the scholars. He didn’t give them a reaction they could find entertaining.

He looked at the merchant.

The merchant was still, eyes steady, expression unreadable.

He nodded once—barely.

A final bid was placed.

The scholars froze. The blue-robed buyer stared, calculating.

The auctioneer’s voice held the last call for a beat longer than comfort.

Silence. Tension.

Then the rod struck the stone with a sharp, definitive crack.

The crowd released breath in a collective motion.

Sold.

John’s chain jerked as the hook disengaged from the post and snapped into a handler’s grip. The handler pulled him off the platform.

John turned his head just enough to see the merchant stand. The man didn’t celebrate. He simply spoke to an attendant, who handed a slate to a clerk. Paperwork. Terms. Ownership.

John’s stomach tightened.

Ownership.

He’d already learned that word without language.

As he was led away, he passed close enough to the blue-robed figure to hear a hissed phrase, sharp with frustration. One word repeated, spit like an insult.

John didn’t understand it.

But he felt its shape: *Dead Zone.*

Distance. Emptiness. A place where their power didn’t work the way it should.

And he was from there.

The handler shoved him through a side corridor into a quieter staging area. The noise of the crowd dimmed behind stone walls. The air here felt slightly less crowded, and John’s headache eased by a fraction.

He used that fraction to think.

He was no longer “market stock.”

He was property of a specific man.

That created a new kind of danger—and a new kind of predictability.

Assets were kept.

Assets were moved through channels.

Assets could be gifted. Traded. Claimed.

John let the handler drag him forward and watched the corridor corners, the guard positions, the clerk stations. He mapped the space as if mapping could turn captivity into a plan.

Behind him, the auctioneer’s rod cracked again, selling the next item.

The market continued.

John did not look back.
