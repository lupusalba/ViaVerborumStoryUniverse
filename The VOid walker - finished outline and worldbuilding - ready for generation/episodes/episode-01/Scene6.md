Dark didn’t come like sleep.

It came like a system shutting down—hard cut, no warning, no gentle drift. One moment there was pain bright enough to be a color, the next there was *nothing*, and then the nothing started leaking images back in around the edges.

Not dreams. Fragments.

A corridor under red emergency strips.

The smell of propellant.

Bravo’s breathing in his ear.

Delta—gone. Not dead on the floor. Just *absent*, like the universe had reached in and removed a piece.

John tried to move his right hand and couldn’t find it. Not physically. In his mind. Like the map of his body had holes.

Pressure behind the teeth. Metallic sweetness. Blood on his tongue.

He tried to assemble a timeline. It slipped. The pieces didn’t fit.

The ship’s hull groaned somewhere deep in his memory. Metal under stress. The particular scream of a structure failing.

He saw it then—without seeing it.

The Alliance ship breaking open.

Not on sensors. Not in an external feed. Just as a certainty that settled into him with the weight of gravity.

Destroyed.

That was the word his mind chose because it was clean. It didn’t leave room for bargaining.

Destroyed meant no return route. No rally point. No medbay. No comms. No chain of command that mattered.

It meant everyone still on it was dead or taken.

John’s chest tightened. Not grief. A physical clamp as his body tried to reject the conclusion.

He forced it through anyway.

Unit status: gone.

He pictured faces in flashes—helmet visors, quick hand signals, the micro-nods of people who understood him without talking. Not names. Names made it personal. Personal made it heavy.

Gone.

Rescue?

His mind reached for doctrine. For procedure. For the idea that somewhere, someone would notice the ship went dark and dispatch a response.

Then it ran the actual distances. The actual unknowns. The actual lack of coordinates. The actual reality of being dragged through space by people who didn’t use the same rules of travel.

No distress beacon. No known route. No pursuit corridor.

Rescue was a story soldiers told themselves to keep moving in bad situations.

This situation wasn’t bad.

It was *other*.

Rescue was impossible.

The thought didn’t hurt the way it should have. It landed with a strange relief—like finally stopping a pointless effort.

He felt himself falling again, not physically but inward, deeper into the blackout.

And in that descent, a different memory surfaced: weightlessness.

Not the comfortable zero-g of drills and transit, but the empty, indifferent float of open space—the void between stars where your body was just mass and your life support was a timer.

He understood then, with the same cold clarity he used in combat:

He had already died.

Not in the corridor. Not under the spell. He’d died the moment the ship was lost and the map of the universe no longer included a path back.

Everything after that was borrowed time.

Borrowed time meant freedom from certain rules. It meant fear lost leverage. It meant the worst had already happened, and the rest was logistics.

He latched onto that like a handhold.

New mission parameters formed in the dark.

Survive.

Observe.

Learn.

He didn’t have language yet. Didn’t have tools. Didn’t have allies.

But he had one advantage he could feel even through the haze and the pressure and the wrong air:

They had touched his mind.

They had proved the rules could be bent.

If reality here could be rewritten by will, then will could become a weapon.

His last coherent thought before the black took him completely was not a prayer, not a scream, not a plea.

It was a decision.

*Learn their rules.*

*Then break them with your hands.*
