The transport didn’t *take off* so much as decide it was somewhere else.

One moment John was braced against a ring in the ship’s belly, teeth aching from the constant pressure in the air. The next, the world lurched sideways inside his skull. His stomach rose hard. The space behind his eyes squeezed like a fist.

Then the pressure eased.

Not gone—nothing was gone here—but eased enough that John could tell the difference.

The hatch opened.

Cold air rolled in, clean and sharp, carrying pine-like bite and damp stone. Real weather. Real dirt. The smell hit him with such blunt normality it almost hurt.

He stepped down onto ground that wasn’t metal.

Grass. Dark soil. A slope that gave under his boot and didn’t ring.

Above him, the sky was pale and bruised like it had been at the market, but out here there were no towers, no crowds, no stink of bodies. Only wind moving through low brush and tall trees. Birds—if they were birds—clicked somewhere distant.

And in front of him, rising out of wilderness like a threat that didn’t need a reason, stood a tower.

It wasn’t ruined. It wasn’t ancient-looking in the way human ruins looked ancient. It was *maintained*. Smooth stone, dark and clean, climbing straight up with no visible windows for most of its height. The base flared slightly, then narrowed, like it had grown out of the earth and decided it belonged.

No village nearby. No road. No smoke, no fences, no signs of a life that wasn’t this place.

Built to keep things out.

Or keep things in.

John’s wrists were still bound. His right hand still half-dead. Two guards held his chain like he might bolt into the trees.

He didn’t bolt.

Running into unknown terrain with no food, no language, and a nervous system already at war with the air was a good way to die slowly.

He kept his posture upright and his face blank and his eyes active.

The approach to the tower was a path only in the loosest sense—flattened grass, a few stones placed with intention. What mattered wasn’t the path. It was what lay around it.

John could **see** the defenses.

Carved channels ran through the ground in repeating curves, shallow grooves that looked decorative until you noticed they never broke pattern. They looped around the tower base in nested rings, like a fingerprint pressed into soil and stone. Here and there, small markers protruded—waist-high posts with symbols cut into them, their edges too sharp to be weathered.

He couldn’t read the symbols.

He could read intent.

This was a perimeter.

The air above certain lines shimmered faintly, not like heat but like light bending around glass. When he shifted his head, the shimmer-lines stayed in place. Fixed. Deliberate.

Tripwires for a world without wire.

He also **sensed** the rest.

Not with any new sense—nothing mystical, nothing magical—just with his body reacting to something it didn’t understand. The skin at the back of his neck crawled. His teeth ached again. The pressure in the air thickened closer to the tower, as if the building had its own atmosphere.

And underneath that, a different feeling: being watched.

Not by eyes in windows. There were no windows.

Watched by the space itself, like stepping into a lit room and knowing a camera was on you even if you couldn’t see it.

John counted steps anyway.

He counted markers. He noted where the shimmer-lines crossed the path and where the guards angled their bodies without thinking, avoiding certain points like it was habit.

They reached the tower’s entrance.

There was no door.

Just a vertical seam in the stone—so fine it looked like a crack in reality rather than construction.

One guard touched the seam with two fingers.

The stone parted without sound.

The opening was too precise, the way a surgical cut was precise.

John’s stomach tightened.

He stepped inside.

The interior air was warmer, dryer, and heavier. The pressure behind his teeth returned in a slow wave. His headache sharpened. The tower didn’t smell like a home. It smelled like clean stone, faint smoke, and something chemical he couldn’t place—like antiseptic without the sting.

The hall was wide and empty, the floor polished so perfectly it reflected light without being glossy. Symbols ran along the baseboards in a band, repeating at regular intervals. Every few meters, a pillar jutted from the wall with a shallow bowl carved into its top. The bowls held no flame, but they glowed faintly from within, steady as if the light source was a decision, not a fuel.

John’s footsteps made almost no sound.

That was wrong too. Stone should answer. This stone absorbed.

He tracked the guards’ spacing. One behind, one left-front, one right-front. The chain was short enough to limit sudden movement, long enough to keep him from tripping.

Asset handling.

The hall turned once, twice, and then opened into a room that changed the temperature of the air in John’s lungs.

A study.

Not a cozy one. Not a human one.

Curated. Controlled. Quiet.

Shelves climbed the walls, filled with objects that looked like books and jars and carved pieces of bone. A table stood at the room’s center, its surface covered with papers, tools, and a shallow dish of dark liquid that didn’t ripple. Tall windows—actual windows—looked out onto wilderness, but the glass was thick and slightly tinted, making the outside world look like something observed through water.

A fire burned in a hearth on the far wall. The flame was too steady. The logs didn’t shift. The heat felt present without crackle.

John stopped where the chain stopped him.

He didn’t look around wildly. He didn’t show curiosity like a tourist. He looked like a man in a room, eyes moving in deliberate passes: exits, lines of sight, objects that could cut or burn or blind.

There was only one real danger in the room.

It arrived without drama.

A man entered through a side door—no guards announcing him, no ceremony. He walked like he belonged to the tower the way a hand belonged to an arm.

He was tall, slim, and dressed in dark clothing that looked simple until you noticed it held shape without wrinkles and moved like it didn’t touch dust. His hair was neat. His face was calm in a way that had nothing to do with kindness.

His eyes landed on John and didn’t flick away.

Not predatory, not angry.

Clinical.

Like John was an interesting specimen.

John’s body reacted before his mind did.

The pressure behind his teeth intensified. The air felt thicker. The skin-crawl along his spine became a steady, cold line.

This was different from the market’s heaviness. That had been ambient, like weather.

This was focused.

A presence.

John kept his chin level. He didn’t bow. He didn’t puff up. He gave nothing.

The man spoke.

The language slid off John’s mind like water off oil. He caught tone only: measured, mildly curious, certain of his own authority.

One of the guards replied quickly, deferential. The man nodded once, then stepped closer.

John’s hands tightened around his restraints. The bands responded by tightening slightly, a warning pressure. He loosened. He wouldn’t waste energy on a leash.

The man stopped at arm’s length, studying John as if he could read bone through skin.

Then he lifted his hand.

John didn’t flinch. Flinching was information.

The man didn’t touch him. He simply held his palm near John’s chest.

John felt it immediately.

Not heat. Not cold.

A sensation like the space inside his ribs had been weighed. Like something invisible pressed inward, gently, but with absolute control. The feeling slid upward to his throat and across his skull.

John’s vision sharpened for a second, then blurred at the edges.

The man’s eyes narrowed with interest.

John kept breathing slow.

He watched the man’s pupils. Watched for the moment curiosity turned into decision.

A second hand gesture.

John felt the air around his injured arm change. Pain flared, bright and clean, as if a finger had plucked the nerve.

He gritted his teeth and kept his face still.

The man’s gaze went to John’s right hand, then back to his eyes.

He spoke again, shorter this time.

A question, maybe.

John didn’t answer. Not because he wouldn’t. Because he couldn’t.

The man’s mouth twitched—not amusement, not irritation. Something like acknowledgment. As if John’s silence confirmed an expectation.

He turned slightly toward the table and picked up a small object: a thin disc of stone or metal, engraved with dense symbols. He held it between two fingers and looked at John over it.

He didn’t ask permission.

He brought the disc closer.

John felt his skin crawl.

The disc’s symbols seemed to catch the light and shift when he tried to focus. The patterns were too precise, too repeating. They made his eyes want to slide away.

The man spoke a few words.

The disc warmed—just enough that John could see it in the way the air above it shimmered.

And then the disc’s presence reached into John like a hook.

Not physically. Not in a way he could describe cleanly.

It was like someone had pushed a thumb behind his forehead and pressed.

John’s stomach lurched.

He forced his feet to stay planted.

The man watched him with a small, sharpening interest. He was *measuring* John’s reaction.

John understood that much.

A test.

The man lowered the disc and said something to the guards. The guards responded in quick, respectful tones.

The man’s eyes stayed on John.

Decision time.

He spoke one longer phrase, and the guards relaxed—by a fraction.

Not less ready. Less tense.

John registered it the way he’d register a safety being flicked off.

The man was keeping him.

Not handing him off. Not disposing.

Keeping.

John didn’t let relief in. Relief made people careless.

The man turned toward the table and moved objects aside with neat efficiency, like clearing a workspace before surgery. He laid the disc down in the center of the table, then placed his fingertips on either side of it.

Everything about the motion said routine.

Like washing hands.

Like putting on gloves.

John’s mouth went dry.

He couldn’t understand what was coming, but he knew it was coming for *him*.

The man spoke to one of the guards and pointed toward John’s head.

The guard stepped behind John and grabbed his shoulders, not roughly but firmly, pinning him in place. Another guard took John’s chain shorter, limiting his movement.

John didn’t resist. He stored the positions, the holds, the angles.

The man approached again, disc in hand.

He held it close to John’s temple.

John felt the pressure behind his teeth spike into a sharp ache. His ears rang. His vision narrowed.

The man spoke—one word, maybe two—and the disc’s symbols flared faintly.

John’s body knew it was under attack before his mind could label it.

Something pushed into his skull.

Not a thought. Not a voice.

A force.

It didn’t slide in gently. It didn’t knock.

It *entered*.

White pain detonated behind his eyes. It wasn’t like a migraine. It was like a blade made of cold light being driven into his brain and twisted.

John’s knees buckled.

The guard behind him held him upright.

The room tilted. The windows warped. The fire became a streak.

John tried to breathe and couldn’t find the rhythm. Air came in too thick, too heavy, and his lungs rebelled.

The pressure behind his teeth became pressure behind everything—behind his eyes, behind his tongue, behind his bones. His right arm pain flared in sympathy, as if every nerve had been invited to the same screaming party.

The man’s face stayed calm.

That was the worst part.

He watched John’s reaction with the detached interest of someone observing a predictable side effect.

John’s vision filled with fragments—symbols, shapes, patterns that didn’t mean anything but insisted they should. The disc’s imprint crawled across the inside of his skull like ink spreading through water.

He tried to clamp down, tried to force his mind into the same disciplined boxes he used in combat: breathe, focus, control.

The spell—if it was a spell—didn’t care about discipline.

It wasn’t persuading him.

It was rewriting him.

John’s muscles seized. His jaw locked. He felt his tongue bite down hard enough to taste blood. The metallic sweetness flooded his mouth.

His hearing became a tunnel. Voices turned into stretched noise. Then even the noise stuttered—like someone skipping a recording.

His right hand spasmed uselessly, fingers curling against numbness.

He got one clear thought, sharp and simple, cut from all the pain:

*This world doesn’t ask permission.*

The man said something—steady, almost bored—and the pressure surged one last time, a final shove deeper into John’s skull.

John’s sight went gray at the edges, then black.

The last thing he felt was the guard’s grip on his shoulders and the cold, smooth certainty of the tower holding him upright as his mind fell away.
