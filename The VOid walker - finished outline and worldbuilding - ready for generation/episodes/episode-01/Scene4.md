John learned the first rule of his new life in the quiet after the sale:

Violence was optional.

Paper wasn’t.

They didn’t drag him through back alleys. They didn’t beat him to prove he was owned. The handler who took his chain after the auction walked him through cleaner corridors and into a holding room that smelled of incense and ink instead of blood and piss.

That alone told John the buyer had status.

The room was built to process transactions. Stone table. Two chairs. A low brazier with coals that never quite flared. Symbols carved into the floor in repeating curves—decorative, maybe, but John had learned to treat every pattern here as a function until proven otherwise.

Two guards stood by the door. Not the market guards. These wore matching uniforms and moved like professionals. They didn’t leer. They watched angles.

Asset security.

John’s chain was clipped to a ring set into the floor. The chain length was deliberate: enough to stand, enough to sit, not enough to reach the door.

He sat anyway. Back straight. Hands loose. Breath slow.

His right arm hung heavy. The numbness had crept deeper over the last day. He flexed his fingers once, minimal motion, to test what he still had. A twitch. Not control. Not yet.

A door opened without a hinge sound.

The man who had bought him entered with an attendant and a clerk. He looked exactly like he had on the tier above the auction floor: calm, clean, expensive without ornaments. He didn’t look at John like a trophy.

He looked at him like a column of numbers that had to balance.

The attendant carried a tray: a slate-like tablet, a stylus, a small block of wax or resin, and a seal stamp made of dark metal. The stamp’s face held an engraved symbol.

The clerk moved to the table and began laying things out in an order that was clearly ritual. Not religious. Administrative.

John watched the order. He watched who touched what. He watched the moment the guards’ posture shifted when the seal stamp hit the table.

Authority object.

The merchant spoke to the clerk. The clerk answered. The words were meaningless, but the rhythm was familiar: terms, conditions, transfer details. The merchant gestured once toward John, and the clerk’s eyes flicked to him with brief, professional interest.

Not human interest. Inventory interest.

The clerk opened a scroll-case or folio and drew out thin sheets—parchment, or something like it—covered in tight symbols. He began writing.

John caught patterns even without meaning: repeated clusters that likely marked names and places. A section near the bottom that looked like warnings, set apart by a different symbol.

He leaned forward a fraction.

A guard shifted instantly. Not threatening. Just present.

John sat back. Message received.

The merchant dipped the stylus, wrote a line, then pressed his seal stamp into the wax with a clean, practiced motion. The wax darkened as if it absorbed something.

John felt the air tighten when the seal was set. A pressure ripple that tickled his teeth.

So it wasn’t just “paper.” It was paper with enforcement.

The merchant didn’t speak to John. Not once.

That was also information. He wasn’t being purchased for conversation.

Two more figures entered. Different uniforms again. These carried themselves like they were used to being obeyed by everyone in the room. One wore a collar piece with a small emblem pinned at the throat.

Government.

A Planetary Governor’s office, or something close enough to serve the same purpose.

The clerk rose, bowed—subtle, fast. The merchant did not bow.

Power recognized power.

The official spoke. The merchant replied. The clerk presented the documents.

The official did look at John.

Not at his injuries. Not at his face.

At the chain point on the floor. At the restraint placement. At the posture.

The official’s eyes narrowed slightly, as if confirming a checklist.

He spoke again, and the clerk wrote more.

Then came the part John understood without language.

The merchant gestured with an open hand toward John—an offering gesture. The official’s attendant stepped forward and touched the chain. Just a fingertip against metal.

Ownership transfer ritual.

John’s skin crawled anyway. His stomach knotted with a disgust he kept off his face.

He kept still. He kept valuable.

The official produced his own seal stamp, larger and heavier, its face marked with a more complex symbol. He pressed it into a fresh block of wax on the paper. When the seal set, the air pulsed harder than before.

John felt it in his skull. A brief squeeze behind the eyes.

A lock clicking into place.

The guards’ posture changed again—subtle, but real. The merchant’s guards relaxed by a millimeter. The official’s guards became the ones holding the room.

Chain of custody complete.

The merchant stepped back. Transaction done.

John was no longer the merchant’s problem.

He was the governor’s property.

John didn’t know what the papers said, but he understood the shape of it: the state had legitimized what the market had done. He wasn’t just captured. He was cataloged. Registered.

That meant nobody could casually kill him without creating paperwork.

Protection.

It also meant nobody could free him without breaking the same system.

Cage.

They moved him almost immediately. No celebration. No delay. The governor’s men didn’t keep him to admire.

He was a gift.

John learned that when the next document came out.

The clerk—now a different clerk with a sharper face—unrolled a shorter sheet and wrote quickly while the official watched. This paper had fewer lines, bigger symbols, and a blank space at the bottom that looked like it existed to hold a signature from someone important.

A request.

A petition.

A tribute.

The governor’s man spoke a name several times. It was longer than the others. It carried weight in the room; even the guards’ breathing seemed to quiet when it was said.

John didn’t know the name.

He recognized the effect.

They were sending him upward. To someone the governor wanted to please.

The official pressed his seal into the paper. Then, after a pause that felt like respect, he pressed it again on a second copy.

Two originals. One for record, one for delivery.

They weren’t just transferring him. They were documenting the transfer so it could be defended later.

John felt cold settle behind his ribs.

This wasn’t a prison. It was a system designed to make itself unchallenged.

They marched him out.

Not through the market. Through cleaner halls and gated courtyards where guards stood at intervals that made tactical sense. The city beyond flashed in glimpses: tall structures held by carved geometry, banners that moved in air that didn’t feel like wind, people in expensive cloth who didn’t look at him long enough to see a man.

John kept his gaze forward. He counted steps. He mapped turns.

They brought him to a transport platform.

A ship waited—small compared to the drifting giants above the market, but still wrong. No engines. No exhaust. A hull that looked like polished stone with lines carved into it like veins.

The guards clipped his chain to an interior ring. Same chain length calculus. Same asset treatment.

Before the hatch closed, the governor’s attendant approached with the sealed documents held in both hands, like an offering. Another attendant received them with the same careful grip, like the papers were fragile or dangerous.

They exchanged a short phrase. Formal. Confirming.

Witnesses.

A final seal pressed.

John felt the air pulse again—stronger this time—and his stomach lurched as if the world had shifted under him.

The hatch sealed.

The ship’s interior light dimmed to a soft gray. The pressure behind his teeth rose, steady and inevitable.

A low thrumming began—not mechanical, not vibration through bolts, but resonance through material. Like the ship was being tuned.

John braced his feet and lowered his center of gravity.

Whatever this transit was—flight, jump, something worse—he treated it like turbulence.

He stared at the sealed hatch and didn’t let himself think about rescue.

Rescue wasn’t coming through a legal wall.

His only path forward was the same as it had been since the corridor under red light:

Live.

Learn.

Then break the rules that held him.
