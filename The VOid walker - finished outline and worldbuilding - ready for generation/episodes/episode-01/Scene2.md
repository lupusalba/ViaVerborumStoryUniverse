John came back to himself in pieces.

First the taste—metal and sweetness, like old blood and burned wiring. Then the pressure behind his teeth, a low, steady ache that made his molars feel too large for his jaw. Then the awareness of his right arm, not as a limb but as a wrongness: numb fingers, a hot line of pain that pulsed up into his shoulder every time his heartbeat remembered it existed.

He opened his eyes.

Dark. Not total—there was a thin, gray wash, as if the air itself held a dim light. The kind you got in a ship when the emergency system was down to its last reserves.

His wrists were bound in front of him. The restraints weren’t metal. They didn’t clink. They didn’t bite the skin the way alloy cuffs did. They simply *held*, pressure with no texture. When he tested them, the bands tightened like they were listening to his intent.

He stopped.

He didn’t waste strength on a tool he didn’t understand.

He tried to flex his right hand. Two fingers twitched. The rest stayed asleep.

Fine motor was gone. Maybe temporary. Maybe not.

John breathed in through his nose and held it for a count of four.

The air tasted wrong even through his helmet—except his helmet was gone.

He was bare-headed.

His suit was gone.

So were his boots, his belt, his knife, his rifle. Everything.

He was in a cell.

The walls were a dull, dark material that swallowed light. Not painted steel. Not polymer. It looked like stone that had been smoothed by water, but it carried a faint sheen, as if it was wet. The floor was the same. No seams. No bolts. Nothing to pry.

A small opening near the ceiling let in the gray wash. No bars. Just a slit that felt more like a decision than a flaw.

John shifted his weight and found his back against a corner. Good. One wall behind him, one to his left. Less exposure.

Across from him, in the opposing corner, a man sat slumped with his knees to his chest. Human. Alliance haircut grown out just enough to look wrong. His face was pale and tight in the dim.

John’s throat tightened before his discipline could clamp down.

Not because it was a friend. Because it was proof. Proof that the surrender had been real, and the capture hadn’t ended in a corridor full of bodies.

The other man lifted his head slowly, like it hurt to do it. His eyes found John and widened.

“Sir,” he rasped.

John cataloged the voice. Familiar enough to recognize as his, not the enemy’s. The man’s pupils were too large. Sweat stood on his upper lip.

“What’s your name,” John said. Not a question. An anchor.

The man swallowed. “Renn. Deck Nine security.”

John nodded once. “How many?”

Renn’s eyes flicked toward the slit near the ceiling, then back to John. “I saw… I saw two more when they dragged us in. Not— not from our section. Different uniforms.”

John let that settle. A handful of survivors, scattered. Not a unit. Not a plan.

“How long?” he asked.

Renn blinked. “I don’t know. I— they took my helmet off and—” He pressed his knuckles to his mouth as if to hold something in.

The pressure behind John’s teeth increased. The air thickened in his lungs. It wasn’t lack of oxygen. It was something else—like the atmosphere had weight, like breathing had become a physical task.

He recognized the feeling in a distant way. The way a diver recognized pressure changes. The way a soldier recognized radiation sickness without a meter.

Wrong environment. Wrong rules.

John forced himself to breathe slow. In through the nose, out through the mouth. He kept his exhale long.

Renn watched him as if waiting for permission to do the same.

John gave it without softening his face. “Match me,” he said. “Breathe. Slow.”

Renn tried. His first inhale hit like a cough. He gagged, fought it, then found the rhythm. His shoulders dropped a fraction.

John took inventory.

Cell: one slit, no visible door. So the door was hidden, or the wall itself opened. Material unknown. No tools. Restraints respond to struggle. Air causes pressure sickness. Right arm nerve damage.

Threats: guards. Transfer. Interrogation. Execution. Or something worse.

He listened.

There was a hum underneath everything, but it wasn’t his ship’s hum. It was lower, irregular, like a living thing breathing in sleep. Occasionally a faint vibration ran through the floor, and John felt it in his bones more than his feet.

Footsteps came in intervals, but not in a predictable patrol cadence. Sometimes two sets. Sometimes one. Sometimes none for long stretches.

John began counting anyway.

Not because it would save him. Because it kept his mind from touching the names of the dead.

The first time the wall opened, it did it without sound.

A section of the dark surface simply… slid aside, revealing a rectangle of brighter gray beyond. The light hurt, and not from intensity. It was the wrong kind of light, as if it carried a pressure of its own.

A figure stood there.

Not human. Tall, lean, limbs too long. Skin like dull brass or cured leather—hard to tell. It wore layered cloth and something that looked like armor but moved like fabric. Its eyes were dark, reflective, and indifferent.

It spoke.

The language didn’t resolve into meaning. It went into John’s ears and came out as sound with no hooks.

The figure pointed at Renn.

Renn flinched hard enough to hit the wall behind him. His breath sped up. He started to shake.

John raised his bound hands slowly, palm out as much as the restraints allowed. A universal sign. Not for surrender—he’d done that already—but for *control*.

“Leave him,” John said, knowing it wouldn’t understand. “Take me.”

The alien tilted its head as if considering him. Then it stepped in and grabbed Renn by the upper arm with a grip that looked casual.

Renn made a small sound like a broken thing.

John’s jaw tightened. He didn’t lunge. The restraints would tighten, and he’d learn nothing.

Renn’s eyes found John, wide and wet. “Sir—”

John stood as far as the cell allowed, just close enough that Renn could see his face clearly.

He didn’t offer comfort. He offered function.

“Breathe slow,” John said. Two sentences, clipped. “Save your water.”

It was a lie in the shape of advice. There was no water to save. But it gave Renn something to do besides break.

Renn’s lips trembled. Then he nodded once, like a man following an order.

The alien dragged him out.

The wall slid shut with the same silent finality.

John stared at the spot where Renn had been and forced his mind to let it go.

He couldn’t afford to build grief into a weapon the enemy could use.

He went back to counting.

The air kept pressing. It made his stomach turn in slow waves. Not enough to vomit—just enough to keep him off balance.

A day passed. Or two. Or the ship ran a cycle that felt like a day because John’s body demanded sleep and wake in patterns it had learned since childhood.

The wall opened again.

This time there were two guards. One looked like the first. The other was shorter, thicker, with a heavy jaw and a scar that ran down its neck like a rope burn.

They tossed something into the cell.

A metal dish. A slosh of water that smelled faintly of minerals and something sweet. Food that looked like a paste.

John didn’t rush it.

He waited until the wall slid shut, then approached, crouched, and examined the dish for traps. There were none he could see. That didn’t mean there weren’t traps. It meant he lacked the senses to find them.

He ate anyway. Small amounts. Slow. He kept his breathing controlled.

His body fought the air as much as it fought hunger. Each swallow felt like pushing against invisible resistance.

He understood then that the pressure behind his teeth wasn’t a symptom of fear.

It was the environment itself.

Something saturated the air. Something that wasn’t radiation, wasn’t chemical, wasn’t any standard contaminant.

It made his skin crawl without touch.

It made his nerves feel exposed.

When he closed his eyes, he could almost feel the space around him like a thick fluid.

He didn’t have a name for it.

He didn’t need one to know it was dangerous.

The third time the wall opened, John didn’t see Renn.

He saw two other humans.

Not Alliance security. One wore remnants of a shipboard mechanic’s jumpsuit. The other had a civilian cut to his clothing—merchant fleet, maybe. Both looked hollow-eyed and bruised.

They were pushed past the cell, down the corridor beyond, toward a brighter area where more voices carried. John caught glimpses of other cells opening and closing. Other captives being pulled out. Herded.

Sorted.

The guards’ behavior wasn’t random. It was efficient.

John watched the pattern: the way the guards checked a symbol on a slate-like object before taking someone, the way they paused longer at certain cells, the way they *touched* the humans with a brief, deliberate contact at the back of the neck, like tagging livestock.

A valuation system.

That was the shape of it.

Not an execution. Not a raid.

A supply chain.

The wall opened again, and this time they came for John.

The thick-necked guard grabbed him by the forearm. Pain spiked in his injured nerves and white flashed behind his eyes. John kept his face neutral.

He rose without resistance. Resistance was a question. The answer would be pain.

They marched him through corridors that didn’t feel like a ship. The angles were wrong—rounded where steel should be sharp. The lighting came from the material itself, not fixtures. The air grew heavier the farther they went.

He passed a holding bay.

Dozens of captives sat or lay on the floor, restrained. Not just humans. Shapes he couldn’t categorize: something with four arms and no visible eyes; something small and furred with a muzzle full of flat teeth; something tall and thin with skin like pale bark.

A marketplace of bodies, staged for transport.

Humans were clustered together, and around them the guards’ attention tightened. The guards didn’t look afraid of the other species. They looked *curious* about the humans.

Like humans were rare.

Like humans were valuable.

John’s stomach turned again, and this time it wasn’t the air.

They moved him onto a platform that might have been a lift. There was no visible mechanism, but the floor shifted under him, smooth as a thought. His balance adjusted. His body stayed calm. His mind stayed sharp.

A hatch opened into a cargo compartment.

This one had seams. Real seams. Bolted braces. Hard edges.

A different ship.

The smell was different too—oil and metal and old sweat. Human-adjacent. Familiar in the wrong way.

Merchants.

The guards handed him off to another set—different uniforms, different posture. These were not raiders. These were workers. They moved like men who had done this a thousand times.

One of them spoke, and the language was still nonsense, but the tone was transactional. A ledger tone. A “here’s the goods” tone.

John was pushed into a smaller cell—steel this time, with bars and a sealed door.

He sat with his back to the wall and watched through the bars as the rest were loaded.

He saw the mechanic in the torn jumpsuit shoved into a cage across the way. The man’s eyes flicked to John for half a second and then away, fast, like contact itself was dangerous.

John understood. You didn’t bond. Bonding made you break when they separated you.

And they would separate you.

The ship lurched.

Not acceleration—something like a sudden drop in gravity, like the deck fell out from under reality for a heartbeat. John’s stomach rose into his throat. The pressure behind his teeth spiked into sharp pain. His vision blurred at the edges.

Then it settled.

The merchant ship’s hum stabilized. The lights steadied.

A jump. Or whatever their version of travel was.

John swallowed bile and forced his breathing slow.

Hours became a blur of enforced stillness.

Water came on a schedule he didn’t control. Food paste came when someone remembered. Sometimes a guard watched him eat. Sometimes no one did.

Sleep came in short, shallow pieces, the kind that left you more tired than before. Every time he woke, the air felt heavier, then lighter, as if they passed through layers of something.

Days or weeks—John couldn’t be sure—dragged past in the same pattern.

Restraints. Rations. Silence. Observation.

He learned small things.

Merchant crew were not cruel for cruelty’s sake. They were indifferent. Indifference was worse, because it wasn’t personal. It didn’t have a weakness you could exploit.

The ship carried other cargo besides bodies. He heard crates shifted, heard something large moved on rails, heard voices rise and fall in argument over value.

And every so often, he heard the same word repeated around humans. Always with a different tone: excitement, annoyance, greed.

A label.

He couldn’t understand the word, but he didn’t need to. It meant *price*.

Once, in a transit bay, he caught sight through a half-open hatch of a human girl—teenager, maybe—being led away. Eyes dead. Mouth moving without sound.

John’s hands clenched in the restraints until they tightened in warning.

He forced them to relax.

He couldn’t save her. Not now. Not here. If he tried, he’d die and learn nothing.

That was the ruthless arithmetic of survival.

He held onto one thought and kept it clean:

This is logistics.

He wasn’t a prisoner in a war. He was inventory in a system.

That meant the enemy wanted him intact, at least until money changed hands.

That meant his window for action wasn’t here.

It would be after the sale.

The ship jumped again. Pressure spiked. Teeth ached. Nausea rolled through him.

John closed his eyes and let the sickness pass through without taking him.

When he opened them, a guard was standing outside the bars, watching him with the calm interest of a man inspecting a tool.

The guard spoke, and this time John caught a gesture: a flat palm sweeping outward, as if indicating a destination.

John didn’t understand the words.

He understood the meaning anyway.

*Almost there.*

He sat back against the steel wall, kept his posture straight, and stared through the bars as if staring could carve a plan into the future.

Escape *now* was a fantasy.

Survive-to-adapt was real.

He’d stopped waiting for rescue in a corridor under red light.

Now he stopped waiting for mercy in a cage full of wrong air.

He would live long enough to learn what these people called reality.

And then he would find the cracks.
