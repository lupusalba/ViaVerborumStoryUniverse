### EPISODE 3 — SCENE 4: THIRD RING

The days stayed the same on the surface.

Carry. Clean. Wait. Touch the band to stone. Feel the thick thump in his teeth. Move when the door released. Stop when it didn’t. Keep his eyes down. Keep his right hand wrong.

John made himself boring on purpose.

Boring servants didn’t get watched.

Inside, everything had changed.

The night he folded the pocket space into his pool didn’t make him stronger in a way anyone could see. It made him *stable*. The constant edge-of-rupture pressure backed off. The shimmer stopped crawling over his hands without permission. The ache behind his eyes became a background bruise instead of a blade.

Room to breathe. Room to think.

Room to train without dying from it.

He didn’t chase spectacle.

Spectacle got you opened up on a table.

He chased repeatability.

At night, he sat on the floor beside the bed with the lamp turned low and treated the air like a range.

He took in a measured sip of ambient mana. Not a gulp. Not enough to swell his shell. Just enough to have something to shape.

Then he bled it out on purpose—not as a relief valve, not as desperation, but as geometry.

A line.

He pictured two points in the room and forced a straight segment to exist between them. Not light. Not heat. Just a held intention that made space feel slightly wrong along that axis.

The first time, it wavered and collapsed in two breaths.

He didn’t swear. He didn’t slam a fist. He watched the failure in his mind and corrected the next attempt.

Too much force. Not enough anchor.

He tried again.

This time it held for five breaths before softening into nothing.

Better.

He repeated it until the line held steady for ten breaths, then twenty, then a full minute with only a dull pulse behind his eyes.

He took notes the way he always did: not on paper, not where it could be found. In a stacked, ranked list in his head.

Breath steady = shape steadier.
Jaw clenched = headache spikes faster.
If he let the boundary define itself instead of forcing it, strain dropped.

That last one mattered.

Void didn’t like being pushed like an element. Void responded when he treated it like placement.

He moved from lines to circles.

Not inner circles—those lived inside him and had consequences. These were outlines in the air: empty rings meant to teach his hands and mind how to hold curvature without drift.

The first ring came out lopsided, heavier on one side. It tugged against his spatial sense like a wheel with a flat.

He adjusted.

He held it. Let it settle. Closed it cleanly.

He did it again. And again.

He learned what “clean” felt like: the moment the edge stopped fighting him and started obeying.

He started building lattices after that.

Intersections. Simple grids. Then more complex.

The first time he tried more than a three-by-three, the structure collapsed and the feedback hit like someone shoved a thumb into his eye socket from the inside.

He lay back on the bed and let it pass without making noise.

Noise brought constructs.

He waited until the ache fell back into a manageable throb, then he went smaller and cleaner the next night.

He began choosing where in the room he trained based on what his spatial sense told him.

Above the bed, the space felt slack—less tension, less resistance. Easier shaping, better for learning new forms.

Near the door seam, the air was taut with wards. Harder shaping, better for discipline. If he could hold a line there, he could hold one anywhere.

He rotated drills like a soldier rotating muscle groups.

Lines to train steadiness.
Circles to train curvature.
Lattices to train complexity under strain.

He treated every session like marksmanship.

One clean attempt was nothing.

Ten clean attempts meant something.

A hundred meant the shape belonged to him.

As the weeks stacked into months, the micro-gates changed with him.

At first, opening one felt like pressing into stretched leather until it finally gave.

Now the membrane gave sooner, cleaner. Less brute force, more precision.

He could open a fist-sized gate without his heartbeat kicking. He could close it without leaving a lingering wrongness in the air.

He timed them.

Seconds became a minute.

A minute became three.

He didn’t push further yet. Endurance was useful. Endurance also tempted people into staying open too long, and staying open too long created patterns the tower might notice.

When three minutes became comfortable, he stepped into the next drill.

Multiple gates.

Two gates were baseline now. He could open and close them like breathing.

Three demanded attention.

Four demanded discipline.

He started with fixed points he could anchor without looking: near his palm, near the far wall, just above the floor by the bed footboard, and a point close to the table leg.

He opened them one at a time, forcing stability before adding the next.

By the time the fourth gate held, sweat had gathered at his hairline and the ache behind his eyes pressed harder.

He held them for ten seconds.

Then he shut them all at once with a controlled exhale and sat still until his pulse slowed.

He repeated it the next night.

And the next.

Four gates held for thirty seconds.

Then a minute.

Then two minutes without the headache rising into danger.

Five gates came with an immediate lesson.

The first attempt, the third gate wavered and collapsed. The feedback snapped through him and he had to bite down on his tongue to keep from making a sound.

He shut the remaining gates instantly and sat in the dark with his hands flat on his thighs, breathing through nausea.

He didn’t try again that night.

The next night he reduced their size.

Smaller openings. Cleaner anchoring. Less strain.

Five held for fifteen seconds.

Then thirty.

Then a full minute.

Then two.

The third circle inside him didn’t finish because he wanted it to. It finished because he kept aligning the same motions until the inside structure had no more argument left.

Six gates was different.

Six wasn’t just strain.

Six was thinking without flinching.

He had to hold six anchor points in his head without letting any one of them blur, and he had to keep each boundary clean against the tower’s ambient pressure and ward tension.

The first time he managed all six open at once, he held them for five seconds and shut them immediately, heart hammering.

He lay awake afterward and listened to the tower.

No ward spike. No sudden footsteps. No thump at his door.

Nothing.

He repeated it.

Six gates held for ten seconds. Then thirty. Then a minute.

When he finally held six steady for two full minutes, he shut them with the same calm he used to lower a weapon after a shot.

He sat motionless, palms resting on his thighs, and listened again.

The tower did not react.

That was its own kind of permission.

Minor displacement stayed last on his list for a reason.

It was the one warm-up that punished him for arrogance.

He tested it only in absolute privacy, only with small objects, only for short shifts.

Pebbles first. Finger-width moves. A sharp spike behind the eyes every time.

But the spike no longer turned into a spiral. The pocket layer dampened the surge. His shell stayed stable afterward.

He expanded carefully: a handspan. Then a foot.

He moved his rag from table to bed in a blink and paid for it with a minute of teeth-clenching pain.

He didn’t do it again for three nights.

Not because he couldn’t.

Because he was learning what “possible” cost, and he wasn’t stupid enough to spend that cost casually.

Months passed like that.

Servant by day. Engineer by night.

And beneath it, the circles inside him tightened.

The first circle was old now, part of his baseline.

The second circle sat clean and close after the pocket fold, reinforcing instead of fighting.

The third circle formed in segments—an alignment, a tightening, a place where the pattern stopped resisting.

John felt it most in what became effortless.

One night he was shaping a lattice—simple grid, then tightened intersections, then a micro-gate pinned at one corner as a stress test—and he realized his breathing was steady.

The ache behind his eyes was present, but it wasn’t rising.

His hands weren’t trembling.

The shapes weren’t wobbling.

He held the structure for three minutes.

Then five.

Then he added another gate—second corner—just to see if it would break.

It didn’t.

Something inside him clicked.

Not a surge.

Not a flash.

A quiet latch sliding into place.

John froze mid-breath.

The lattice did not collapse. If anything, it sharpened, edges cleaner and more exact, as if the world itself had stopped arguing with him.

He lowered his hands slowly and let the shapes dissolve on purpose. He didn’t trust himself not to stare at them and forget where he was.

He sat on the floor in the dim light and looked at his hands.

Three years ago he’d been a captive body with a ruined tongue and dead fingers, strapped into pain because someone wanted to see what would happen when he broke.

Now he could cut holes in space and move objects without touching them.

He didn’t feel joy.

He felt inventory.

A weapon is a weapon, even when you built it out of warm-ups.

He tested the new baseline immediately.

Six micro-gates opened without the old spike of panic pain.

He held them for a minute and felt only a steady pressure behind his eyes.

He reached outward with spatial sense and felt the room more clearly than he ever had. The ward seam at the door was a tight line. The corners were dense reinforcement. The air above the bed was slack.

He pushed farther—careful, controlled.

His awareness extended beyond the room, into the corridor, out to the rhythms of the tower’s spaces he knew. Not sight. Texture. Tautness and slack. Held and unheld.

He stopped when the texture began to blur.

Roughly a hundred meters of reliable sense, anchored by familiar shapes.

Useful.

Dangerous.

He pulled it back.

Displacement remained expensive. Medium-range self-shifts were *possible* in theory now, but the cost would be ugly and the risk higher than he could justify without perfect conditions.

He didn’t try it.

Not yet.

By morning he was a servant again.

He dragged the right hand slightly, as if it didn’t obey. He let his shoulders slump. He kept his expression blank.

He moved through corridors and watched doors and ward seams like they were faces.

Now he mapped differently.

Not just what opened.

What mattered.

Doors that pressed his teeth harder when he passed. Doors that made his spatial sense read taut and layered. Doors that didn’t care about his band at all.

Forbidden zones by feel. Casil’s spaces by absence—places no servant was routed, places where constructs turned him away without explanation.

And then Casil’s routine shifted.

It started with correspondence.

Sealed tubes arriving more often, delivered by a construct that moved straighter than the others, as if it had been given a higher-priority line in its own mind. The wax seals were marked, the tubes handled carefully.

Casil took them alone.

John only ever saw the delivery and the door closing.

That was enough.

Then the travel chest appeared.

Leather-bound, edges reinforced, etched with preservation wards that made the air around it feel crisp and tight to John’s sense. It sat where it shouldn’t have—near a corridor junction outside Casil’s study spaces—like someone wanted it ready to move.

Packing sounds followed.

Muted scrapes through stone. Drawer shifts. Glass clicking softly. Metal touching metal once, then carefully separated, like counting equipment.

And the way Casil spoke to constructs changed.

Less immediate command. More delegation.

Maintenance tasks assigned in sequences. Contingency instructions. “If this, then that.” A tone that assumed absence.

John carried a tray past a forbidden door and kept his eyes down as the seam shifted slightly, just enough for sound to slip through.

“—conference cannot be missed—”

The words were clipped, irritated.

A pause, then another fragment, quieter.

“—three days, perhaps four—”

The door sealed with a thick thump. Pressure brushed John’s teeth.

He didn’t react.

He kept walking at the same dull pace, right hand hanging wrong, face empty.

Inside, his mind narrowed to a single clean line.

Without Casil present, the tower would still have wards. Constructs. Rules.

But it would not have *judgment*.

Constructs defended patterns.

Casil defended intent.

John reached his room that night, shut the door with the band, and sat on the edge of the bed with his hands on his thighs.

He didn’t rush to plan the whole escape. He didn’t let himself fantasize.

He just counted.

Three days.

Maybe four.

He reran the tower as a system without its master.

Which constructs would patrol. Which would maintain. Which would respond to alarms. Whether the function-mark band could be revoked remotely or needed physical presence. Which doors would still refuse and which might be bypassed with micro-gates if he could anchor beyond the ward line.

He reached outward with spatial sense and pictured the corridors he knew, the door seams, the taut places.

He didn’t move yet.

Movement was later.

Preparation was now.

In the dark, with the tower’s pressure humming steady around him, John let the last thought settle—sharp, simple, and dangerous.

Three days. Maybe four.

That’s when the tower stops being his and starts being mine.
