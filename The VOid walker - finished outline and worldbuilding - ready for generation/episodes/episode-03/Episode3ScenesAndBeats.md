## EPISODE 3 — Scene Cards (canonical)

### S1 — The Student (Library & Learning)

* **POV:** John
* **Setting + time:** Casil’s tower; ~1.5 years after Ep2 end; routine established
* **Goal:** Turn servant mobility + library access into **usable power** without exposure
* **Pressure:** Wards/construct oversight; Casil spot-checks; language headaches; keep “impaired hand” mask
* **Turn:** Confirms hard limit—**no non-void casting** → pivots fully to void fundamentals
* **Exit hook:** “If these are warm-ups, then nobody’s watching for what I do with them.”
* **Beats:**

  * Nights = study until pain; days = work + map tower.
  * Builds private reference system (knots/cloth markers; mattress-frame scratches; memorized priority stack).
  * **Show notes once:** kneels, fingers trace scratched circle theory/flow/aspect categories.
  * Tests fire/water/earth forms → all fail; mana won’t cohere outside him.
  * Tries different structures/densities → same collapse pattern.
  * Cross-checks affinity-locked mage texts → framework matches him.
  * Hypothesis locks: **absorption universal; casting isn’t.**
  * Switches to void/space chapters; “precision over power.”
  * Learns: **micro-gates**, **spatial sense**, **minor displacement** (costly/limited).
  * Only drills in guaranteed privacy; resets posture + fake clumsiness.
  * Labels in text: “warm-up exercises” → John sees the combat blind spot.
* **Rules check:** Absorb anything; cannot cast non-void. Void basics only. Secrecy absolute.

### S2 — Balcony Geometry (Bird Sniping / “Sniper” breakthrough)

* **POV:** John
* **Setting + time:** Balcony during a work break; specific day
* **Goal:** Prove micro-gates can be weaponized (not a trick)
* **Pressure:** Short window; must look idle/harmless; precision demands
* **Turn:** First “gate-barrel” kill → combat paradigm flips
* **Exit hook:** Begins covert geometry drills; stops caring about “missing fireball.”
* **Beats:**

  * Rare quiet minute; no eyes.
  * Bird ~50m out; reflex: rock throw.
  * Normal throw rejected (angle/visibility/speed).
  * New question: “What if the throw happens somewhere else?”
  * Places **Gate A** near bird, **Gate B** by his hand.
  * **Gate sensation:** piercing two points at once; taut membrane gives; space folds to intention.
  * Drops pebble through Gate B → exits Gate A → instant kill.
  * Waits for alarms/ward response → nothing.
  * Realization: *geometry beats elements.*
  * Tests constraint: placement needs clean visualization / LoS confirmation.
  * Closes gates; resets servant posture; leaves unchanged outwardly.
* **Rules check:** Micro-gates low-cost, precision-bound. Targeting needs reliable visualization/LoS. No anomalies left behind.

### S3 — Battery (Shell Crisis + Pocket Dimension)

* **POV:** John
* **Setting + time:** Weeks compressed into crisis; climax in one decisive night (room + library)
* **Goal:** Prevent shell rupture by creating **1:1 internal pocket dimension**
* **Pressure:** Escalating symptoms; time running out; “dead-end” theory with lethal failure modes; cannot seek help; execution pain/strain
* **Turn:** Success—1:1 pocket stabilizes shell; John becomes a void **battery**
* **Exit hook:** Relief reveals the new danger: capacity so high that Casil must never detect it.
* **Beats:**

  * **Crisis escalation:** fullness becomes structural; headaches constant; stretched-skin tension; involuntary shimmer; teeth ache; routine checks show upward trend; 2nd circle forming but not enough; math says inevitable crack; timeline = weeks or less.
  * **Research:** pushes library harder than cover allows; standard overload fixes don’t match his intake; finds “impractical/forbidden” notes—internal pocket dimension inside mana pool; all prior attempts end in death; failure modes listed (collapse/rupture/rejection); John predicts *why* they died: they tried “more inside than outside.”
  * **Decision:** reframes from storage → reinforcement; designs **1:1** pocket (pool size = pocket size); accepts trade (not more object volume, but stronger containment); chooses attempt night; preps room like field op.
  * **Execution:** sits; finds pool edges/shell; folds space inward with void; inside/outside blurs; “spatial wrongness” pain; holds the 1:1 ratio through instability; critical point—lock or die; **fold locks**; pressure vanishes; shimmer quiets; tests intake/dispersion; capacity expands; “double walls” formed; side effect: 2nd circle completes immediately; 3rd begins.
  * **Aftermath:** body tests clean; deliberate ambient intake flows smoothly; confirms rupture threat gone; forces servant-normal mask; adds knot to strip (“survived impossible”); final thought: if Casil understands, this becomes dissection-tier attention.
* **Rules check:** Pocket dimension is taboo/impractical; John makes it viable via strict 1:1 geometry. Capacity + stability jump. Circle progression accelerates. Secrecy is life-or-death.

### S4 — Third Ring (Mana control drills → 3rd circle; hook into Ep4)

* **POV:** John
* **Setting + time:** Months compressed → ~Year 3; training spaces + private room
* **Goal:** Convert capacity into precision control; complete 3rd circle quietly
* **Pressure:** Maintain cover; avoid sensors; mental strain; temptation to overreach
* **Turn:** 3rd circle completes; void toolkit stabilizes and expands
* **Exit hook:** Casil prepares to leave tower—John starts counting days until constructs defend alone
* **Beats:**

  * Shifts from surviving → engineering.
  * Control drills: lines/circles/lattices; marksmanship mindset (repeatability, error correction, timing).
  * Micro-gates smoother/faster; holds extend (minutes).
  * Multi-gate stability ramps: 4 → 5 → 6 held steady.
  * Tests short-burst self-displacement only in absolute privacy (high cost/risk).
  * Documents constraints mentally: strain thresholds, recovery windows, detection risks, max range before visualization fails.
  * 3rd circle stops feeling like wall → feels like lock alignment.
  * **3rd circle completes** during a control drill; no outward display.
  * **Emotional beat:** looks at his hands—no celebration; acknowledgment.
  * New baseline: 4–6 stable gates; minutes-long maintenance; ~100m spatial awareness; medium-range displacement possible but expensive.
  * Strategic insight: tower defense assumptions (elemental range) are brittle against void geometry.
  * Servant routes now become recon: important doors, forbidden zones, Casil’s spaces.
  * **Sharpened hook:** sealed correspondence increases; travel chest appears; Casil packs; delegation tone shifts; overhears “conference… three days, perhaps four.”
  * Final beat: John counts days; recalculates tower defense without Casil; plans the window.
  * **Exit line:** “Three days. Maybe four. That’s when the tower stops being his and starts being mine.”
* **Rules check:** Higher circle = more simultaneous gates, duration, sensing, range. Displacement remains risky. Cover stays intact. Casil absence sets Ep4 attack window.
