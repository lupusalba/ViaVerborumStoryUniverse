### EPISODE 3 — SCENE 3: BATTERY

The first warning wasn’t pain.

It was the way the tower’s door-thump stopped feeling like a momentary pressure and started feeling like a hammer strike that kept echoing after the door was already closed.

John stood in the corridor outside the laundry alcove with a basket on his hip, waiting for a construct to pass. The door behind him had sealed a heartbeat ago. The familiar pressure in his teeth had come and gone—except it hadn’t gone. It stayed as a dull ache along his molars, like he’d been clenching for hours.

He shifted his weight, slow and servant-tired. He let his right hand hang wrong at his side. He kept his face empty.

Inside, his mana pool felt swollen.

Not full in the way it had felt in the early tests—tight skin and heat and a need to bleed it out through hands and feet. This was different. This was structure under strain. The shell he’d built with circles wasn’t just holding pressure. It was *bearing* it.

He could feel the edge of it the way you could feel a bruise you weren’t touching.

The construct passed without looking at him. Stone feet on stone floor. No curiosity. No pity.

John waited until it was gone, then moved again, basket steady, gait deliberately uneven.

Every step made his teeth ache.

By the time he reached his room that night, the ache had become a constant line of pressure behind his eyes. He shut the door with the banded wrist. The stone thumped. His jaw tightened without permission.

He stood in the dark for three breaths, listening.

No footsteps. No ward shift that suggested attention.

He set the basket down and sat on the bed. Hands on thighs. Back straight.

He reached inward.

The pool pushed back.

It had always been there—an internal presence that took whatever the world poured into him and refused to break. He’d learned to manage it. He’d learned to disperse the worst buildup in controlled bleeds, faint shimmer out of palms and soles that relieved the tightness without giving himself away.

Now, when he pressed for the usual valve, the pool didn’t feel like a reservoir. It felt like a container whose walls were beginning to creak.

He didn’t panic. Panic made mistakes.

He tested.

He opened the dispersion method—small, controlled. A thin release through his left palm first, then the right, then down through his feet into the stone.

For a moment, relief came. The pressure behind his eyes eased.

Then the fullness surged back, faster than it should have.

John stopped the bleed and sat still, listening to his own breath.

His hands itched.

Not skin itch. Space itch. The same wrongness he felt when a micro-gate opened—except he wasn’t opening anything. A faint shimmer crawled over his fingers and vanished.

Involuntary.

He stared at his right hand. Kept it still. Made it look weak even to himself.

“Not now,” he whispered.

The imprint language scratched at his skull. The ache behind his eyes pulsed sharper. He stopped speaking.

He didn’t need words. He needed numbers.

Over the following days, he measured everything.

He didn’t have tools. He had routine.

How long he could work before his teeth started to ache. How often the shimmer appeared without him calling it. How much dispersion bought him before the pool climbed again. How quickly rest helped. How much food mattered. How much sleep mattered.

The answers came back the same way every time.

Rest helped a little.

Food helped a little.

Dispersion helped a little.

And the trend kept rising.

The tower was saturated with mana. His body absorbed it whether he wanted it or not—ambient seep, incidental contact, the pressure of wards when he moved through doors. Even reading in the library seemed to pull it into him, as if the organized weight of that place encouraged intake.

He could reduce it by starvation, by lying still, by refusing to breathe too deeply.

He tried that for one night.

By morning his hands shook with hunger and the pool still felt swollen.

He accelerated circle work.

It was the obvious answer. Every text said it: circles were containment. Circles were compression. Circles were stability. Each ring layered around the pool tightened control and increased capacity.

His second circle had been forming slowly, reluctantly, like it wanted to tear away from the shell the moment he tried to define it. Now it responded to urgency. It thickened. It drew closer. It took shape under pressure like bone healing thicker after a break.

Compression helped.

It still wasn’t enough.

One night, halfway through a controlled bleed, he felt it—an internal slip, tiny but unmistakable. A strain line along the shell. Not a crack, not yet. Just a place where the pressure found leverage.

John shut down the dispersion instantly and sat in the dark with sweat cooling on his back.

He didn’t need the library to tell him what that meant.

Absorption rate greater than compression rate, plus dispersion losses, equaled eventual failure.

He didn’t know exactly when. Weeks, maybe less.

He did know the end state.

Shell rupture.

He’d seen what Casil did to him when his body failed under external pressure—how quickly Casil escalated tests, how calmly he watched, how he treated pain like data.

If John ruptured now, it wouldn’t be an accident. It would be a phenomenon Casil could study.

The difference between torture and dissection wasn’t intent. It was tools.

John stood in his servant room and looked at his bed, his table, his thin blanket.

He didn’t have a workshop. He didn’t have wards. He didn’t have instruments.

He had his body.

He had void.

And he had a library.

The next day he moved faster than was safe.

Not running. Never running. Just efficient in ways a servant wasn’t supposed to be.

He carried trays, took routes that let him pass doors he wanted to test, lingered in corridors long enough to feel the ward tension and memorize it. He kept his right hand limp, his shoulders slightly hunched, his eyes down.

When he reached the library, the difference hit him immediately, as it always did.

The air there was heavier, but not oppressive. Organized. Filtered. Like the tower’s pressure had been combed into neat lines. His spatial sense read it as structure—patterns laid deliberately, not the diffuse weight of the rest of the building.

It made his teeth ache.

He ignored it.

A construct watched him as he moved between shelves. Not close. Just present.

John selected books like he was obeying a list, because he was. The list just wasn’t for his duties.

He needed one answer.

How do mages handle mana overload?

The first books gave him the same calm lies the tower liked.

Eat well. Rest. Build circles. Don’t be reckless. Let mana settle. Seek guidance from a master.

He turned pages with steady hands and felt his patience flatten into something sharp.

Those answers assumed a normal intake. An apprentice pushing too hard. A mage overcasting.

Not someone who absorbed everything the world threw at him and kept absorbing when no one threw anything.

He shifted categories.

Containment theory. Failure cases. Ward engineering. Void applications.

Each move deeper into the library came with a subtle change in pressure. The air grew tighter, the ward patterns more deliberate. Some shelves had a faint resistance you could feel before you touched the spines, like the tower wanted to ask who you were and why you were reaching.

John made his face dull. He let his right hand fumble slightly as if he couldn’t grip the books properly. He made the construct see a servant struggling with weight.

It didn’t help him. It didn’t stop him either.

He found older texts with fewer lies.

Margins filled with notes from people who had argued with the printed words. Diagrams that showed circles failing. Accounts of mages who had tried to expand capacity by brute force and died young.

And then—half-hidden behind a set of treatises on spatial wards—he found what the earlier books avoided mentioning.

A slim volume with a plain spine and no title on the outside.

He pulled it free and opened it.

The first page was stamped in harsh ink.

IMPRACTICAL. DO NOT ATTEMPT.

John’s pulse stayed steady. The stamp didn’t make him hesitate. It made him read faster.

The writing was dense but not mystical. It was the kind of language scholars used when they wanted to strip romance away from magic and leave only method.

Internal pocket dimension construction.

The concept was written as if it was an obvious extension of void work: if you could cut a gate between two points, you could fold space into a cavity. If you could create a cavity, you could store volume.

The text framed it as a solution to storage, transport, and—buried in a later section—mana containment.

He read that line twice.

Space created inside the mana pool. A fold within the reservoir itself.

A place for pressure to go.

John’s teeth ached so hard he nearly ground them together. He forced his jaw loose.

He flipped forward.

The next pages were not theory. They were documentation.

Attempt One: collapse. The cavity did not stabilize. The mage’s internal space folded inward on itself and crushed tissue from inside.

Attempt Two: rupture. The cavity tore open under stress and vented uncontrolled void pressure outward. The mage died instantly, body scattered across the room.

Attempt Three: rejection. The fold was held for three breaths, then the mage’s body simply… vanished. No residue. No remains. Only a note from the observer: *reality rejects impossible geometry.*

John’s fingers tightened around the page edge.

He turned more pages.

More attempts. More deaths.

Sometimes the cavity formed and then ate the mage’s containment shell like rot spreading. Sometimes it formed, held, and then ripped open without warning. Sometimes it failed to form at all and the effort triggered a seizure that killed the mage by exhaustion.

The text didn’t hide it. It cataloged it.

Failure modes:

—Spatial collapse (internal crush)

—Dimensional rupture (explosive vent)

—Reality rejection (erasure)

He stared at the list until the words stopped being ink and became a threat.

Then he read the analysis that followed.

Every attempt had aimed for more.

More volume than the body could hold.

More inside than outside.

A bigger space hidden in a smaller container.

The text treated it as the natural goal. Infinite storage. A vault in your chest.

And every attempt died chasing it.

John closed his eyes and breathed slowly.

He could feel his mana pool inside him, swollen and straining, the shell holding but slipping.

He didn’t need infinite storage.

He didn’t need a vault.

He needed the shell to stop creaking.

He opened his eyes and read the next paragraph as if it was a confession.

*Reality rejects impossible geometry.*

More inside than outside was impossible geometry.

But what about equal?

What about a cavity that did not try to cheat the world?

A pocket dimension with a strict ratio.

Not bigger.

Same.

A mirror.

He flipped back to the diagrams and studied them with the cold focus he used for routes and doors.

The basic fold pattern was familiar now. Micro-gates were punctures. This was a fold held and shaped, anchored to internal points rather than external.

He could do void.

He could anchor.

The risk wasn’t the fold itself. The risk was arrogance—trying to create more.

John’s breathing stayed even as the decision formed.

He would not make more.

He would make walls.

A 1:1 internal pocket dimension. Same size as his mana pool. A reinforcement layer. Double containment.

It wouldn’t store objects. It wouldn’t solve transport. It wouldn’t impress any scholar.

It might keep him from rupturing.

He closed the slim book carefully and slid it back into place. He didn’t take it. Taking it would be evidence. Taking it would be a question asked later.

He took three other books instead—boring ward texts the construct would recognize as normal labor. He tucked his knowledge into his head the way he always did: prioritized, stripped down, held tight.

When he left the library, the air outside felt messy. Less controlled. Less safe.

His teeth ached all the way back to his room.

That night he sat on the bed and reached inward, testing the pool.

The shell creaked.

The shimmer crawled over his fingers without permission.

He didn’t have weeks.

Maybe he had days.

John stared at the blanket, the table, the wall.

He measured the risk.

Attempting the fold could kill him.

Doing nothing would kill him slower—after the shell gave way, after the tower noticed, after Casil decided the failure was interesting.

He didn’t know which death was cleaner.

He did know which death allowed a chance.

He chose a night the tower felt quieter.

Not truly quiet. Just less active.

Casil’s patterns were predictable if you watched long enough. Certain nights he stayed in his workroom late, the ward pressure around the upper levels tightening like a drawn cord. Certain nights he left earlier, the pressure loosening as the tower shifted into maintenance mode.

Tonight, the air felt less tense. The door-thumps in the corridor were fewer. The constructs’ routes were slower.

John ate the food left for him even though his stomach wanted to twist. He needed strength, not comfort. He drank water until his mouth didn’t feel dry.

Then he prepared his room like he was setting up a field op.

Everything that could fall was moved to the floor. The table shoved tight against the wall. The basket tucked under the bed. No loose objects near him that could scatter if something went wrong.

He laid the blanket folded at the foot of the bed, not for warmth but for appearance. If someone opened the door later, the room would look normal at a glance.

He checked the door seam and reached outward with spatial sense.

The ward pattern there was taut, alert. It didn’t care about his internal work. It cared about him crossing the boundary.

Good.

He needed privacy, not permission.

He sat in the center of the bed. Back straight. Feet planted. Hands on thighs.

He let his right hand rest wrong, like it always did, because habit was cover and cover was survival.

Then he closed his eyes.

He went inward.

He found his mana pool the way he’d learned to find pain in the tests—by locating its edges.

A presence. A volume. Not physical, but as real to him as muscle.

The shell around it felt thick. Reinforced by the first circle, strained by the second forming. It held pressure like a drum skin stretched too tight.

He could feel where it slipped when the pressure surged. A weak point that wasn’t a crack yet.

He didn’t touch it. He didn’t push against it.

He reached deeper.

Void was not an element. It was a permission to change placement. To fold. To connect.

Micro-gates were punctures between two points in the world.

This would be a fold anchored to points inside him.

John pictured his mana pool as a space he could step into if the world allowed it. He pictured its boundaries, not as walls, but as coordinates. Anchors.

Then he pictured a second space, identical in size, pressed tightly against the first like two sheets of cloth aligned edge to edge.

1:1.

No cheating.

No “more.”

Just a second layer that could share the load.

He pushed.

The sensation was nothing like opening a micro-gate.

A gate was a clean puncture—membrane giving, hole forming, connection snapping into place.

This was bending something that didn’t want to bend.

The world inside him resisted in a way that made his skin crawl. His sense of inside and outside blurred, as if his body couldn’t agree on where it ended.

A spike of wrongness ran through him, sharp enough to steal his breath.

His teeth clamped. Pain flared behind his eyes.

He forced his jaw loose. Forced air in.

The fold began to form anyway, thin and unstable, like a soap film trying to hold shape.

John anchored it.

He held the 1:1 ratio in his mind with ruthless clarity. The size of the pool. The exact boundary. No expansion. No compression. Just matching.

The wrongness deepened.

It wasn’t tissue pain. It wasn’t injury. It was the sense that his body existed in two locations at once and neither location was entirely correct.

His stomach lurched.

He kept still. Any movement was distraction. Any distraction was death.

He felt the fold shiver.

The thin film inside him wavered, trying to collapse inward like the failure cases. Trying to crumple under pressure.

John tightened his focus and forced it *not* to crumple.

Not bigger.

Not smaller.

Equal.

His breath came in controlled pulls. He counted them like reps.

One.

Two.

Three.

The pressure behind his eyes swelled into a white-hot line. His temples throbbed. His teeth ground.

His right hand twitched.

Old injury memory, the nerve burn echoing under stress. Fingers spasmed, trying to curl into a fist.

He ignored it. He kept his focus on the fold.

The shimmer crawled over his palms. Not a bleed. Not release.

Instability.

He could feel the shell creak harder, pressure pushing for an exit.

Hold, he thought, without words. Hold.

The fold wavered again.

He sensed the brink—a moment where the geometry would either lock into a stable structure or tear itself apart.

His body trembled. Not from fear. From strain.

He anchored the edges again, aligning boundary to boundary. He forced the fold to accept the same size, the same shape, the same constraints.

The wrongness reached a peak so intense it felt like a blinding flash behind closed eyes.

Then—

It snapped.

Not like a break.

Like a lock clicking shut.

The fold stabilized.

John gasped and nearly doubled over, but he held posture with sheer will, because any collapse now could still unravel what he’d built.

The pressure that had been grinding his teeth eased.

Not slowly.

Immediately.

The ache behind his eyes dropped from knife to bruise. The tightness in his skin loosened. The involuntary shimmer over his fingers quieted as if someone had turned off a noise.

John sat perfectly still, breath shuddering, listening to the inside of his body.

The pool was still there.

The shell was still there.

And now there was something else: a second boundary pressed against it, sharing the strain.

Double walls.

He didn’t celebrate. Celebration was noise.

He tested.

Carefully, he opened a thin intake from the ambient mana in the room—just enough to feel flow.

The pool accepted it without surging. The shell did not creak. The second boundary held steady.

He stopped intake.

He tried controlled dispersion, the valve he’d used for months, letting a small bleed out through his palms.

The release was smoother. Less frantic. Less visible. The shimmer was faint and controlled, not crawling without permission.

He shut it down and waited.

No rebound surge.

John’s throat tightened with something close to relief. He swallowed it down.

He reached inward again, deeper this time, and felt the circles.

The second circle—half-formed and stubborn—was no longer fighting against a swollen container. The pressure that had been warping the geometry was gone.

The circle tightened as if it had been waiting for this.

It completed with a quiet internal alignment, not dramatic, just… correct.

John’s breath caught anyway. A second ring locked around the pool, clean and stable.

Then, without him forcing it, the beginning of a third structure flickered at the edge of perception, like the first sketch line of a ring that would come later.

He opened his eyes into the dark.

The room looked the same.

He felt different in a way that terrified him.

He was not a container on the edge of breaking anymore.

He was a battery with room to charge.

That was power.

That was also a reason for Casil to take him apart.

John sat on the bed for a long time, letting his breathing normalize. Sweat cooled on his skin. His hands stopped trembling.

He checked his body the way he always did after surviving something:

Teeth: pressure present, but tolerable. Not the grinding ache.

Head: dull background throb, not a blade.

Skin: normal tension, no stretched feeling.

Balance: steady when he stood.

He rose from the bed and took one careful step, then another. No dizziness. No weakness. His legs held him cleanly.

He flexed his right hand.

It opened and closed with perfect control.

He let it go slack again immediately, because habit kept him alive.

He crossed to the small table, moved like a man who didn’t trust his own fingers. He reached under the mattress and pulled out the cloth strip with the knots.

The knots were tight, deliberate. A private record of time and endurance.

John’s fingers—steady now—tied a new knot.

He made it tighter than the others.

Survived impossible.

He tucked the strip back into hiding and sat on the edge of the bed, forcing his shoulders to slump slightly, rehearsing the posture he would wear tomorrow.

Servant posture. Safe posture.

He reached outward with spatial sense, testing the room.

The ward boundary at the door still felt taut. The corners still felt dense. The space above the bed still felt slack.

Nothing about the tower had changed.

Only him.

He lay back and stared up at the dark ceiling.

He couldn’t sleep yet. Not with adrenaline still buzzing in his blood, not with the new stability humming under his skin.

He tested intake again, smaller this time, just to be sure he wasn’t imagining the shift.

Mana flowed in clean. It settled without straining the shell. The second boundary held, silent and solid.

He shut it down and let out a slow breath.

A thought surfaced, sharp and cold.

If Casil ever realized what had happened inside John—if Casil understood that the “leakage” wasn’t failure, that the shimmer was controllable, that the shell wasn’t weakening but being reinforced—

The tower’s experiments wouldn’t continue the way they had.

They would escalate.

Not drowning and crushing and burning. Not tests to see what he absorbed.

Tools. Cuts. Dissection. A scholar’s hands inside a living subject.

John’s stomach tightened.

He forced it loose with breathing. Forced his mind back to the same discipline that had gotten him through the worst days: focus on what he could control.

He could control his mask.

He could control what he showed.

He could control his intake now, which meant he could control his capacity without leaving visible signs.

He could keep this hidden.

He had to.

The tower shifted somewhere distant—stone pressure changing, a door thumping far above. John felt it in his teeth, faint now, and realized he hadn’t flinched.

He stared at his hands in the dark.

Not in wonder.

In inventory.

Hands that could fold space. A body that could take almost anything and now had room to take more.

He didn’t want more.

He needed it.

Because the only thing more dangerous than being Casil’s property was being Casil’s *project*.

John rolled onto his side and pulled the blanket up, careful to keep his right hand visible in the way a weak hand would be visible—slightly curled, slightly wrong.

When his breathing finally slowed enough to let sleep approach, the last thought he allowed himself was not triumph.

It was a rule.

Hide this deeper than dispersion.

Hide it the way you hide a knife when you’re living in someone else’s house.

Because if Casil ever saw the blade, he wouldn’t stop until he owned the hilt.
