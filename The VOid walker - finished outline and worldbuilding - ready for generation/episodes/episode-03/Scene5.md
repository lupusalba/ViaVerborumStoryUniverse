### SCENE 5: THE WINDOW

John woke before the lamp in the corridor dimmed.

Not because his body needed less sleep. Because his mind wouldn’t let him waste the hours Casil had just promised would be empty.

He lay still and listened to the tower breathe.

The ward-pressure in the stone was steady, but there was a new undertone—tight lines shifting up above, like someone drawing cords across a ceiling. Packing. Sealing. Preparing.

He rolled out of bed and went to his knees beside the frame.

His fingers found the scratches under the wood. Circle marks. Flow breaks. Void anchors carved deeper than the rest.

He traced the void mark once, then pulled the knotted cloth strip from its hiding place and added a knot—small, tight.

Day count. Window approaching.

He tucked it away and forced his right hand slack again before he stood. The hand worked perfectly now. That made it dangerous.

He dressed in servant cloth and waited for the first route assignment to find him.

It always did.

A construct arrived in the corridor with silent certainty and a tray balanced on stone hands. It didn’t speak. It didn’t need to. It turned and walked, and John followed because the tower’s rules were carved into his days.

He carried. He cleaned. He moved through doors that recognized the band on his left wrist and stopped at doors that didn’t.

He counted ward-thumps the way he used to count blows.

Two thumps meant a barrier shifting state. One thick thump meant a seal setting. A higher, sharper pressure meant a door that wasn’t meant for him at all.

He passed Casil’s study corridor once, head down, right hand hanging wrong, and the air there felt *busy*. Not foot traffic. Not noise.

Decision.

Casil’s presence in the tower was usually a pressure all its own—subtle, threaded through everything, like the wards were tuned to him the way a dog was tuned to its owner.

Today that pressure felt… gathered. Concentrated upstairs.

John’s spatial sense brushed the upper levels and found hard edges: sealed containers, preservation wards, layered bindings stacked like boxes inside boxes.

The travel chest.

He didn’t look for it. He didn’t need to. He could feel it tightening the air.

A few hours later, while John was wiping stone in a corridor he’d cleaned a hundred times, he heard leather scrape.

He kept his eyes on the rag.

The travel chest passed behind him, carried by two constructs. The air around it felt crisp and cold, ward-lines so clean they made the rest of the hallway feel sloppy.

John didn’t turn his head. He let his right hand fumble the rag once, as if his fingers had betrayed him.

Servant. Broken. Harmless.

The chest vanished into an upper stairwell.

A minute later, Casil walked past.

No robe flourish. No performance. Just controlled motion and a stillness that made the tower’s pressure tighten in response.

John lowered his gaze further. He let his shoulders round.

Casil did not stop.

But as he passed, John felt something shift—like the tower looked at John through Casil for half a second and decided what he was worth.

A voice, calm and bored, carried back without Casil turning.

“Maintain your duties.”

John kept his mouth shut. Speaking invited headaches.

Casil continued.

Then, almost as an afterthought: “Do not touch what you do not understand.”

The warning wasn’t new. The timing was.

John bowed his head a fraction, because compliance was camouflage.

“Yes, Master,” he said quietly.

The imprint language pricked behind his eyes. He swallowed it down and went back to wiping stone.

When Casil’s footsteps faded, the corridor did something it only did around Casil.

It *relaxed*.

Not kinder. Not safer.

Just less aware.

By late afternoon, the tower’s mood changed again.

The upper-level pressures that had been knotted tight started moving outward—like a cord being pulled from a spool. The travel chest left. The sealed correspondence followed. A few smaller items, wrapped in wards, moved out with them.

And then Casil left.

John didn’t see the departure directly. Servants weren’t invited to watch masters come and go. But he felt it in the structure of the tower: a pressure-lattice that had always flexed around Casil’s presence straightened.

The air didn’t lighten.

It became more rigid.

Systems without judgment.

Constructs adjusted immediately.

Their routes changed. Patrols that had been loose became deliberate. Two constructs that normally stayed near the kitchens began moving up and down the main stairwell at measured intervals.

John watched without watching.

He finished his assigned tasks and returned to his room at the normal pace, with the normal posture, with the normal limp in his right hand.

He shut his door. The thick thump pressed his teeth.

He stood in the dim for a moment, palm against stone, and reached outward with spatial sense.

The tower felt different.

Without Casil, the ward web was cleaner to read—less subtle shifting, fewer “soft” adjustments. The patterns were fixed. Hard rules in stone.

Hard rules could be mapped.

John sat on the bed and took a slow breath.

Three days. Maybe four.

He had the window now.

He didn’t move immediately.

Moving immediately was how you got noticed by routines that had just recompiled.

Instead, he waited until the patrol cycles settled into repetition. He listened for the cadence in door-thumps in the corridor. He felt the ward tension shift at predictable intervals as constructs passed certain junctions.

When he had the rhythm, he stood.

He let his right hand hang wrong. He practiced one small stumble, because clumsiness was a key that opened doors inside people’s assumptions.

Then he stepped into the corridor and became a servant again.

He didn’t walk straight to a forbidden door. That would be intent, and even systems noticed intent when it was obvious.

He took an assigned route that naturally passed near three places he wanted to measure.

First: a stairwell junction where the air always felt taut. He paused with a basket at his hip, eyes down, and let spatial sense brush the corner.

Ward-lines crisscrossed there like tight thread. Not just a door ward. A boundary web, layered. A place designed to catch shortcuts.

Second: a storage corridor that his band sometimes opened, sometimes didn’t—depending on which door.

Today, one door that had refused him last week released with a firm thump when he touched it.

John didn’t hesitate. Hesitation looked like thought.

He entered with the same bored gait and closed it behind him.

The corridor inside was narrower, unfinished stone, colder air. A service vein. The kind of place that existed to be ignored.

His spatial sense immediately read the difference: fewer “polite” wards, more blunt barriers. Lines that didn’t care who you were—only whether you belonged.

He walked it, counting, memorizing.

Third: a place he’d only ever felt from a distance.

A knot.

Not a door. Not a room.

A concentrated pressure in the tower’s body that made his teeth ache even when he was two corridors away. A place where ward texture was so dense it felt like the air was packed tight.

The tower’s heart.

He approached it indirectly, coming up behind it through service stone, like a man drifting while he worked.

He stopped at the last bend.

The door at the end wasn’t marked. It didn’t need to be. The ward seam around it was thick enough that his spatial sense registered it like a wall of taut cloth pulled across a frame.

His band would not open this.

He didn’t touch it.

He stood with his basket and rag and let himself feel the boundary without pushing against it.

The ward web here wasn’t just layered. It was keyed. Alive in a way the other wards weren’t. It wasn’t preventing entry so much as *refusing recognition*.

Authority lived on the other side of that door.

John didn’t know if it was the core itself, or a conduit, or simply a protected node in a larger system.

He didn’t need certainty yet.

He needed options.

He leaned closer, enough that his breath fogged faintly in the colder air near the seam. He didn’t touch the door. He didn’t even raise his left wrist.

He pictured two points.

Point one: near his left palm, hidden by the basket rim.

Point two: beyond the door seam, just far enough to be “inside.”

He pushed a micro-gate—tiny, needle-sized, the smallest puncture he could manage.

The sensation hit like his fingertip touching a hot surface.

Resistance.

Not a wall. A rejection.

The membrane did not give. The point beyond the seam wasn’t a point he could claim. The ward web didn’t just block the opening. It blurred the *target*.

His headache spiked once, sharp warning.

John stopped immediately. No forcing. No stubbornness.

He took a slow breath, let the pain settle, and stepped back.

So.

Micro-gates didn’t bypass keyed authority wards if he couldn’t anchor cleanly on the other side.

Not yet.

Not without a better anchor.

Not without access to whatever the tower used as permission.

He turned away from the door like a bored servant losing interest and walked back down the service corridor at the same steady pace.

He had learned something without leaving evidence.

That was the only kind of learning that mattered here.

He rejoined the main routes as the patrol cycle passed a junction. A construct brushed by him without pausing. John let his right hand drag slightly, as if the rag was heavy.

He made himself forgettable.

By the time he reached his room, the tower’s pressure had settled into a new normal.

Casil was gone.

The systems were awake.

John shut his door, sat on the bed, and reached inward.

His pool was stable. The double walls held. The circles sat tight. The third ring hummed like a completed mechanism.

He had time.

He had capability.

He had a plan forming.

Then the tower flinched.

Not a door-thump. Not a ward settling.

A distant impact—felt through stone as a heavy tremor, like something had struck the tower’s outer defenses.

John sat up straight, every lazy posture falling away inside the room where no one could see.

A second impact followed, sharper, accompanied by a sudden tightening in the ward web. His teeth ached. The air in the room felt more taut, as if the tower had drawn in a breath.

A third impact.

And then a change that made his stomach drop.

The patrol cadence outside his door broke.

Constructs moved faster. Stone feet struck stone with urgency. Ward seams in the corridor shifted states in quick succession—thumps overlapping, pressure stuttering.

Alert.

John reached outward with spatial sense and felt it: tension lines pulling toward the tower’s perimeter, like threads being yanked from a loom.

Someone was hitting the tower.

Not a visitor.

Not a courier.

An attack.

He stood, fast and silent, and forced his right hand slack again out of reflex—then stopped and let it hang however it wanted, because there was no audience in here and he needed function more than disguise.

He walked to the door, palm hovering near the seam, and listened.

The tower’s breathing had changed.

Systems had blind spots.

But systems also had alarms.

John exhaled once, slow.

The window hadn’t even properly opened.

And it already had teeth.
