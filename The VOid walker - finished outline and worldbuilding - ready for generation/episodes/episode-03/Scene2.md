### EPISODE 3 — SCENE 2: BALCONY GEOMETRY

The balcony was an assigned stop on his route, not a privilege.

A wide stone ledge wrapped around the tower’s midsection, open to air that tasted cleaner than the corridors. The railing was waist-high and old enough that the stone had rounded at the corners. From here the grounds below looked like a model: paths cut with intent, a courtyard, a patch of scrub where nothing grew straight.

John stepped out with a shallow wooden bucket and a rag, because that was what a servant did when he needed an excuse to be alone for three minutes.

The door behind him sealed with the familiar thick thump. Pressure in his teeth, brief and firm, like the tower had pressed a finger to his skull and then let go.

He didn’t turn to look at it.

He moved to the railing and started wiping the same section he’d wiped yesterday. Not because it needed it. Because repetition made him invisible.

The function-mark band on his left wrist stayed warm against his skin. The tower’s leash. A token that let some doors recognize him and reminded everything else to watch.

Wind pushed at his hair. He kept his face blank.

He listened for footsteps.

Nothing.

Not the scrape of boots, not the measured glide of a construct, not the soft murmur of Casil’s robe along stone. Just the distant hush of leaves and a faint chime from somewhere below—metal touching metal, a pendulum in a yard ornament, something living making noise because it could.

John kept wiping. Counted heartbeats. Let his eyes scan without looking like he was scanning.

Empty.

Good.

A bird landed on the far end of the railing, forty or fifty meters away. Small, gray-brown, bold enough to claim the stone like it belonged to it.

John’s first thought was automatic.

*Rock to the head.*

Old muscle memory. A quick throw. End of problem.

He evaluated it in half a second and discarded it.

The angle was bad; he’d have to wind up. That would draw attention if anyone glanced out a window. The throw would be a guess in the wind. And if he missed, he’d have to explain why a servant was throwing rocks off the tower.

He kept wiping, slowing his breath.

The bird tilted its head, watching him.

John’s second thought came as a question.

What if the throw happened somewhere else?

He didn’t smile. He didn’t let anything change in his face. He just shifted his weight like he was tired and rested his forearms on the railing.

His right hand hung loose, a practiced dead weight. He let the fingers curl wrong, slow. He made it look like the hand bothered him.

His left hand did the work.

He reached into the bucket as if searching for a cleaner corner of cloth. His fingertips closed around a pebble he’d dropped in there earlier, small and dull, the kind that wouldn’t be noticed if it went missing.

He didn’t look at it.

He let his gaze stay on the courtyard as if he was bored.

Inside, he reached outward with the sense he’d trained in the dark.

Space wasn’t empty. It had texture.

The air at the balcony doorway felt taut—wards laid like invisible cords. The open air beyond the railing felt looser, but not free. The tower’s influence stretched out like a hand.

The bird’s space was its own small pocket of slack around a living thing.

John anchored two points in his mind.

Point one: a few inches from his left palm, hidden by the bucket rim. Point two: a handspan from the bird’s chest, slightly to the side so the exit wouldn’t flare directly in its line of sight.

He did not picture distance. He pictured *contact.*

He pushed.

The sensation hit instantly.

Two points in reality, stretched tight like skin, yielding at the same time. Not ripping. Piercing. A taut membrane giving way to pressure and intention.

His breath caught in his throat, and he forced it to keep moving.

A micro-gate bloomed near his palm, just big enough to take the pebble. Its edge was absence shaped clean. The air around it felt wrong in a way his body recognized now—like standing too close to a drop you couldn’t see.

The second gate hung near the bird, aligned to face it.

John kept his posture slack, servant-tired, arms on railing. He let his shoulders sag.

Then he made the motion small.

A flick of his left fingers, like he was snapping water off the rag.

The pebble left his hand and vanished into the near gate.

It did not arc through the wind.

It did not travel across distance.

It simply stopped being here and became there.

The bird’s head jerked once. Its body collapsed as if a string had been cut. A dull thud against stone, then nothing—just limp weight sliding and tipping.

The bird fell off the railing and vanished down toward the scrub below.

John did not move.

He waited for the tower to react.

For a warning pressure in his teeth. For a ward to tighten. For the door to thump open and a construct to step out, silent and certain.

Nothing happened.

Wind. Distant chime. The faint smell of wet stone.

John kept his face blank and closed the gates with the same care he’d opened them, letting the membrane snap back into place without a ripple.

The wrongness in the air disappeared.

He held still for three more heartbeats.

No alarm.

He swallowed slowly.

The thought that formed was so clean it felt like it belonged to someone else.

*I don’t need ranged elemental spells. I need geometry.*

He didn’t let that line warm him. Warmth led to mistakes.

He needed constraints.

He needed to know what made it work—and what would make it fail.

He pretended to adjust the bucket’s position, shifting it along the railing by a few inches. His left hand stayed inside the rim where no one could see it.

He chose a point beyond the balcony, not on a living target this time. A notch in a tree trunk in the courtyard’s far corner, half-hidden by leaves.

He tried to place Gate A there without staring at it—using only the idea of where it was.

The air resisted.

Not like a wall. Like a hand trying to guide his fingers away from a hot surface.

His spatial sense gave him information: the point was fuzzy, the image unstable. Leaves moved. Shadows shifted. His mind couldn’t hold the location clean.

He pushed anyway.

A gate formed—barely—then wavered. The edge shivered, the boundary losing cohesion.

Pain flared behind his eyes, sharp warning.

John closed it instantly.

Too sloppy. Too expensive. Too much risk for nothing.

He tried again, this time locking his gaze on the tree notch until it was the only thing he saw. He forced himself to memorize it as a fixed point: shape, depth, the curve of bark around it.

Then he placed the gate.

It opened clean. Stable. The membrane gave in that same precise way.

He dropped the pebble through Gate B with a gentle push.

It struck the tree with a soft click that no one would ever hear from here.

He shut both gates and leaned back against the railing as if he’d just stretched sore muscles.

So.

Line of sight mattered. Clean visualization mattered. Anything that moved, anything he couldn’t anchor, made the placement unstable and the cost spike.

That was not a limitation. It was a rule.

Rules could be worked with.

Rules could be weaponized.

John wiped the railing again, slowly, because his pulse had quickened and he needed it to slow before he went back inside. He let his right hand drag a little, clumsy, the rag slipping through fingers that were pretending to be weak.

He watched the courtyard with his eyes half-lidded.

In his head, he started building a list.

Range: unknown ceiling. He’d done fifty meters without strain. One hundred might be possible with a strong anchor. Past that—later.

Angle: Gate A did not need to face him. It needed to face the target.

Speed transfer: whatever he pushed through carried over. It wasn’t magic throwing the pebble. It was his hand, redirected.

Multiple gates: he could open two easily now. More would be training.

Stability time: seconds were comfortable. Minutes would come with circles and practice.

Detection: the tower did not react to one clean micro-gate. That was information worth more than the kill.

He heard it before he felt it: the faintest shift in the corridor beyond the balcony door, a pressure change like a held breath.

John’s body went still.

The door thumped once. Not opening. Just the wards changing state.

Someone nearby.

He didn’t turn. He didn’t rush. He kept wiping, a servant doing a servant task, and let his right hand fumble a little more than necessary.

A heartbeat later, soft footsteps approached on the other side of the stone. Not Casil’s. Too light. A construct, maybe, moving with purpose.

John kept his breathing even.

The door did not open.

The footsteps passed.

The pressure eased.

He didn’t let his shoulders drop in relief until the tower had gone quiet again.

He finished the section of railing he’d been “cleaning,” wrung the rag out into the bucket, and stood with the same bored posture he’d started with.

On the outside, nothing had changed.

Inside, everything had.

He picked up the bucket with his left hand, let his right hang like it couldn’t be trusted, and walked back to the door.

When he touched the stone with the banded wrist, the tower recognized him. Not kindly. Not warmly.

Correctly.

The door released with a thick, controlled thump, pressure brushing his teeth as it opened.

John stepped through without hesitation, because hesitation looked like guilt.

The balcony air vanished behind him. The corridor swallowed him into organized stone.

He did not look back.

But the image stayed in his mind anyway—two punctures in reality, linked by intention, a pebble moving like a bullet without crossing the space between.

He could make a weapon out of warm-ups.

And no one was watching for that.
