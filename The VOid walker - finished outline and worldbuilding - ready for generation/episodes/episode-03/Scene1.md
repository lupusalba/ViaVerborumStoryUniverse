### EPISODE 3 — SCENE 1: THE STUDENT

The tower never truly went quiet.

Even at night, it breathed. A low, organized pressure threaded through the stone—wards settling, pathways holding, doors remembering who belonged where. John lay on his back in the servant room’s narrow bed and listened until the patterns felt familiar again.

When he was sure there were no footsteps in the corridor, he rolled out of bed and went to his knees beside the frame.

His fingers found the scratches on the underside of the wood. Not words. Not really. More like a map he could read with skin and memory.

A ring with a deliberate break—flow entry. Three short lines—compression steps. A tight spiral—pain threshold. Boxes for aspects, each with a mark beside it: fire, water, earth, air, light, dark. Void didn’t fit inside the boxes. Void had its own section, carved deeper, like he’d been angry when he did it.

He traced the groove he’d made for circles—clean and simple. One ring. Then a second half-formed ring marked with tiny nicks where it always wanted to slip.

He’d stolen every piece of this. Not from Casil’s mouth. From Casil’s library. From watching how doors responded to the band on his wrist. From feeling the tower react when Casil walked past and the wards bent like reeds toward a river.

John sat back on his heels and flexed his right hand.

The fingers moved without complaint. Fine control, full range, strength back in the grip. The hand that had once been a dead weight from nerve burn and deliberate injury now opened and closed like it had never failed him.

He let it hang limp anyway. He practiced the slackness until it looked natural. A slight tremor. A delayed response. Pain that wasn’t there.

The band on his left wrist stayed warm against his skin. Plain on the outside. Function-mark. The tower’s way of saying: this one is allowed in *some* places.

Not free. Allowed.

He stood, crossed to the little table, and took the cloth strip from beneath the edge of the mattress. It was a torn piece of linen, frayed at both ends, knotted in tight clusters. Count marks. Days. Sessions. Survived nights. Private victories he couldn’t speak aloud.

He tied one more knot.

Not for tonight. For the fact that he was still here at all.

The door behind him gave a soft, thick thump—pressure in the stone shifting. Not opening. Just the wards settling again, like the tower was clearing its throat.

John froze, hand hovering over the cloth strip.

Silence.

No second thump. No scrape of stone. No footsteps.

He exhaled slowly and tucked the strip away.

The tower liked to remind him it was listening.

During the day, he had been everywhere he was allowed to be.

Servant routes. Hallways that looked the same until you measured them by the pull of the wards in your teeth. Storage rooms with shelves that held glass and metal and sealed clay. Wash basins that refilled themselves when no one watched. Kitchens that never held fire, only heat shaped by formations hidden under stone.

He carried trays. Wiped dust. Moved books under supervision. Sorted jars in a room that smelled like crushed leaves and old blood.

All of it was cover.

All of it was reconnaissance.

Every door had a personality. Some yielded with a gentle release when the band touched them. Some stayed firm and cold, indifferent to him. Some let him in but pressed on his tongue the whole time, like a warning.

He cataloged it all. Quietly. Without looking like he was thinking.

At night, he became something else.

A student. A thief. A man trying to build a weapon out of scraps.

He reached under the blanket and pulled the borrowed volume free. The cover was plain. The spine was cracked with use. The title had been stamped in clean lettering that his eyes now recognized without him having to fight for it.

Foundations of Circles and Flow.

The language imprint in his skull still hurt when he pushed too hard. Reading was like grinding a blade against stone: possible, useful, and punishing if you rushed it.

He set the book on the table and lit the small lamp with the matchless wick the tower provided. The flame wasn’t fire. Just light shaped into a steady glow, obedient to a pattern.

John started with the page he’d marked earlier using a hair-thin strip of cloth.

Basic projection forms. Beginner spell structures. The kind of thing apprentices did in their first season.

He read them anyway.

He needed to know what “normal” looked like. Only then could he define what he was.

He let the words settle into his head: structure. Flow. Boundary. Release.

He moved the book aside and sat on the floor, back against the bed.

If he made a mistake, he wanted to be able to collapse quietly. Not knock the table over. Not leave evidence.

He closed his eyes and reached inward.

Mana was always there now. Not just inside him—outside, in the air, in the stone, in the seams between things. The tower was saturated with it. Casil’s home world was a different universe than the dead one he’d come from. Here, you could breathe power.

His body took it like a sponge.

Absorption wasn’t the problem.

Projection was.

He built the first structure the text described for fire. Simple. A small coil, a directed release, a spark shaped into heat.

He pushed.

Mana gathered. Obedient at first. Then it lost interest.

The structure collapsed like wet sand.

Nothing happened. No heat. No light. Not even a flicker.

John tried again, tightening the pattern. Slowing the flow. Pressing harder.

This time, the mana didn’t even pretend. It drifted out of his control the instant it crossed the edge of him, dissolving into the ambient pressure of the room like it had never belonged to him.

He opened his eyes and stared at his empty palm.

“Fine,” he muttered under his breath, the foreign language rough in his mouth. Speaking always lit a thin ache behind his eyes.

He switched to water. The text’s “blade” form—thin, controlled, a clean line that could cut if the density was right.

He shaped it. Released.

Mana slid away. Structure failed. Nothing.

Earth. A wall. A lift. Any kind of firmness.

Nothing.

He sat still for a long moment and let the frustration burn down into something colder.

This wasn’t a beginner’s mistake. He wasn’t misreading the diagrams. He wasn’t forgetting a step.

The mana was refusing him.

Not his intake. Not his endurance. Not his ability to hold it.

His ability to *make it obey* once it left him.

He turned the book back toward himself and flipped pages, careful not to make the paper rasp too loud.

He found the section he’d been circling around for weeks—the part that hadn’t seemed relevant until it was the only thing that matched reality.

Affinity limitation.

He read slowly, forcing himself not to rush even when the words felt like a lifeline.

Some mages were broad. Some could shape several aspects with practice. Most had a handful they could learn, one that came easiest. And a few were locked.

Locked meant the body accepted mana broadly but could only *express* it through a narrow channel. You could pour a river into a bottle, but you could only pour it out through the bottle’s neck.

John swallowed. The ache behind his eyes pulsed once, sharp, like the imprint didn’t like him understanding.

He kept reading.

Case examples. Notes. Patterns.

Locked mages could still *hold* other mana. They could be fed. They could be “charged.” It would sit inside them. Sometimes it would strengthen them physically. Sometimes it would poison them. But when they tried to project it into forms outside themselves, it slipped loose. It wouldn’t bind.

That was him.

He could absorb anything Casil threw at him. Fire. Water. Pressure. Darkness. Light that hurt like needles behind the eyes.

But casting?

Casting wasn’t absorption.

Casting was command.

And the only command his body seemed willing to enforce was the one he’d stumbled into during the tests—the one Casil called an “affinity” like it was a preference.

Void.

John stared down at the page until the ink blurred, then blinked hard and set the book aside.

It wasn’t good news.

It also wasn’t a dead end.

He had been trained to work with constraints. In the old world, you didn’t get everything you wanted. You got what you had. You made it lethal.

He breathed in through his nose, out through his mouth, and shifted his attention inward again.

Void wasn’t a thing the way fire was a thing. Void didn’t burn. Void didn’t flood. Void didn’t build walls.

Void changed where things were.

It cut the rules at the joints.

The library didn’t treat it like combat magic. The notes he’d found on void theory were written with the kind of disdain reserved for tools that weren’t glamorous.

Warm-ups.

Exercises.

Preparatory drills for apprentices before they touched “real” void work like gates and storage and long-range displacement.

John liked warm-ups. Warm-ups were where you learned how to move.

He raised his left hand, palm up. The band on that wrist stayed quiet, indifferent. It didn’t care what he did in his own room. Or it couldn’t sense it. Or it was confident the tower would handle it if he went too far.

He would find out later.

For now, he kept it small.

Micro-gate.

The text described it with clinical detachment: two linked openings of minimal diameter, maintained by sustained flow, used to teach basic spatial anchoring.

John closed his eyes and pictured two points in the room.

One near his palm. One near the far wall, just above the floor, where the stone met the wood baseboard.

He did not picture distance. He pictured *connection*.

He pushed.

The sensation was immediate and unmistakable.

Like pressing a fingertip into stretched leather until it finally gave.

Not tearing—piercing. Two points giving way at once, reality yielding to intention. A tight membrane accepting a puncture.

John’s breath caught.

He opened his eyes.

A ring the size of his fist hung just above his palm. The edge wasn’t light or dark. It was *absence shaped cleanly*. A boundary that made the air around it feel slightly wrong.

Across the room, the second ring hovered in the spot he’d chosen. He could see the stone behind it. He could also see through it.

Not a window.

A hole.

He leaned forward and moved his fingertips toward the edge of the near gate.

The air at the boundary felt taut. Like walking up to a drum skin. The pressure wasn’t hostile. Just firm.

His fingers passed through.

On the other side, he felt cool stone.

Across the room.

At his fingertips.

John pulled his hand back slowly and let out a tight laugh that had no joy in it. Just disbelief.

He forced the gates closed before his body could get excited and make a mistake.

The rings collapsed without drama, the membrane snapping back into place like it had never been pierced.

His head throbbed once, a dull warning. Small work, but still work.

He sat still until his pulse slowed.

Then he shifted to the second warm-up.

Spatial sense.

The text described it as “perception training.” A way for void mages to stop treating space like empty air and start treating it like a surface with shape.

John breathed, relaxed his shoulders, and reached outward without pushing.

At first, there was nothing. Just the room. Stone. Wood. The usual weight of the tower.

Then it clicked.

Space had texture.

Not visible. Not audible.

Felt.

The air near the door was taut, as if the ward boundary pressed gently inward. The corners of the room felt denser, like the tower had reinforced them with unseen structure. The space above the bed felt slack, loose, less watched. The space beneath the table felt tight, organized, held in place by something old and deliberate.

It wasn’t emotion. It wasn’t imagination.

It was information.

John opened his eyes and stared at the door.

He couldn’t see the ward lines. But he could feel where they wanted him to stop.

Good.

That meant he could also feel where they were weakest.

The thought came uninvited and he shoved it down. Not yet. Not tonight. Tonight was education, not rebellion.

He released the sense slowly. Let the world become “normal” again.

The room felt emptier without it.

He didn’t like that.

He moved to the third warm-up with caution.

Minor displacement.

The text treated it like a party trick. Shift a small object a few inches. Teach the apprentice that space could be bent without cutting it.

The cost was noted in a single line: “high strain, low yield.”

John believed it. He’d felt what opening gates did, even at fist size.

He placed a small pebble on the floor in front of him—one he’d pocketed earlier from a servant errand. Nothing special. Just stone.

He stared at it until the shape of it filled his mind. Weight. Edges. Position.

Then he pictured it *elsewhere*. Not far. A finger-width to the left.

He pushed.

The pressure behind his eyes spiked like a nail driven in too deep. His teeth clenched. His stomach tightened.

The pebble shivered.

Then it slid.

Not rolled. Not pushed by air.

It simply relocated, scraping a faint line across the stone as if reality had blinked and corrected itself.

John sucked in a breath through clenched teeth and leaned forward, palm pressed to the floor to steady himself.

Pain washed through his skull in a slow wave. He held still until it receded to a manageable ache.

High strain. Low yield.

Accurate.

But it worked.

He stared at the pebble in its new position and felt something in his chest loosen, not from relief, but from clarity.

Elemental projection wasn’t his path. It didn’t matter how much he absorbed. It didn’t matter how strong his shell became. If his body wouldn’t bind fire into a shape outside him, then fire might as well not exist.

Void obeyed.

Void listened.

Void was labeled “warm-up” because most mages didn’t bother asking what warm-ups could do to a throat, an eye, or a heart.

John did.

He sat in the dim lamp light, breathing carefully, letting the headache settle into the background. He flexed his right hand once—fine, steady—and then deliberately let it slacken again, rehearsing the weakness for the world outside his room.

He looked at the open book on the table. At the neat diagrams. At the dismissive tone of the notes.

Warm-up exercises.

He could almost hear Casil’s voice, calm and bored, dismissing anything that wasn’t immediately useful to *him*.

John’s mouth tightened.

He reached under the bed frame one more time and traced the deep-carved void mark he’d made beneath the circle diagrams, as if promising it something.

Then he blew out the lamp and lay back down.

In the dark, with the tower’s pressure humming around him, the thought stayed sharp and clean.

“If these are warm-ups, then nobody’s watching for what I do with them.”
