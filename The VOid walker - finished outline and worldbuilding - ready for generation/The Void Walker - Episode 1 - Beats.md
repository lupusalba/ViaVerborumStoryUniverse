# Episode 1 beat cards (revised)

## Scene 1 — THE FIGHT (~2,000)

- **POV:** John (terse, tactical, efficient)
    
- **Setting/Time:** Human Alliance ship corridors during breach
    
- **John’s goal:** Keep people alive long enough to break contact / reach a defensible fallback.
    
- **Opposition:** Unknown boarders + “impossible” effects
    
- **Turn:** He realizes it’s not winnable—only survivable.
    
- **Exit hook:** Forced surrender → capture.
    

**Beats**

1. Red alert. John is already moving before the siren finishes its first rise—training overrides fear.
    
2. He builds a kill funnel: angles, fields of fire, overlapping coverage; short commands, no speeches.
    
3. First contact: disciplined bursts, controlled retreats, casualty triage on the move.
    
4. **Sensory horror “impossible” (visceral):** the corridor _warps wrong_—straight lines feel bent; the air turns metallic and sweet; static crawls under his teeth; a shadow steps out of a corner that’s too shallow to hold a body; sound stutters like a skipped record; one of his rounds hits and the impact _doesn’t make sense_—no spark, no splash, just a brief absence where matter should be. (Magic or magic-like tech, but read as bodily wrongness.)
    
5. John tests reality: probe shots, then immediate reposition—never trusting cover twice.
    
6. An effect peels their advantage away (visibility, cover integrity, or gravity “tilt”); panic threatens the line.
    
7. He clamps it down with structure: simple orders, audible breathing cues, “follow me” momentum.
    
8. Close-quarters breach: enemy presence becomes undeniable and intimate—too fast, too quiet.
    
9. John’s arm injury: nerve damage—pain + loss of fine control.
    
10. He switches to gross-motor solutions (brace, press, point-blank), keeps tempo despite pain.
    
11. He searches for evac routes; the ship’s systems are failing and paths are cut.
    
12. He sees the strategic picture: they’re being _taken_, not just killed—capture behavior.
    
13. Decision: stop bleeding lives into a doomed corridor. Live to learn.
    
14. Weapons down—controlled surrender. He watches hands, feet, and restraint placement like it’s another drill.
    

**Rules check**

- No magic from John. The “impossible” is experienced through senses, not explained.

## Scene 2 — THE CAPTURE (~1,500)

- **Setting:** Holding cells → transfer to merchant convoy
    
- **John’s goal:** Assess, endure, preserve options, avoid being singled out.
    
- **Opposition:** Pirates/slavers; ambient mana sickness
    
- **Turn:** He recognizes the logistics: they’re being routed for sale.
    
- **Exit hook:** Separated and shipped onward.
    

**Beats**

1. Cell door seals. Different ship-hum. Different air.
    
2. John inventories damage and resources; turns the cage into a problem set.
    
3. Mana exposure hits: wrong pressure, thick/oily air; nausea and pressure headache creep in.
    
4. He studies guard rhythms through sound and vibration; maps the unseen.
    
5. Pirates sort captives; humans are tagged as valuable cargo.
    
6. **New humanizing beat:** In the holding bay, John catches a minute with one surviving crew member before separation—two sentences, clipped. The other man is shaking; John steadies him with a hand to the shoulder and a practical lie (“breathe slow—save your water”). It’s not comfort, it’s function—but it lands as humanity. (Moments, not monologues.)
    
7. Transfer: restraints, prodding, language he can’t parse; he watches anyway.
    
8. Sold to a merchant convoy; John and survivors are split.
    
9. Journey blur: days/weeks in a holding cell, dehydration cycles, enforced silence.
    
10. Conclusion: escape-now is fantasy. Survive-to-adapt is real.
    

**Rules check**

- Ambient mana is physical discomfort first, mystery second.
    

---

## Scene 3 — THE SALE (Black Market) (~3,000)

- **Setting:** Black Market planet → pens → sale floor
    
- **John’s goal:** Survive selection; avoid the worst buyer; learn the rules.
    
- **Opposition:** Dehumanization; alien environment; inspection.
    
- **Turn:** First real sight of mana-civilization scale (divide established).
    
- **Exit hook:** Bought by wealthy merchant.
    

**Beats (extra room for worldbuilding)**

1. Planetfall: gravity feels “soft” then heavy; the air tastes charged—alive.
    
2. Holding pens: rows of cages/pits; species that shouldn’t exist without magic.
    
3. John scans infrastructure like a soldier: choke points, guard sightlines, response times.
    
4. Worldbuilding breath #1: flying ships drifting overhead with no visible propulsion; the shadow of one passes like a slow eclipse.
    
5. Worldbuilding breath #2: buildings held by formations—geometry doing the job of steel; patterns shimmer when the light hits them wrong.
    
6. Worldbuilding breath #3: “tech above a certain complexity fails” vibe—everything functional here feels _ritualized_, engineered through magic, not machines.
    
7. The market’s moral rot is organized: pirates → merchants → rich buyers → officials.
    
8. John clocks the human price: unevolved Dead Zone humans are rare, valuable, mysterious.
    
9. Brief human interactions in pens—short, cautious exchanges; nobody has hope to waste.
    
10. Pre-sale handling: cleaned just enough to present; treated like inventory.
    
11. Buyers arrive: merchants, nobles, researchers; inspection is clinical, curious, hungry.
    
12. John chooses posture: valuable, controlled, not “problematic.”
    
13. Sale moment: language he can’t understand, intent he can—numbers rising, eyes narrowing.
    
14. Hammer falls: purchased by a wealthy merchant.
    

**Rules check**

- Show “Dead Zones vs Mana-Rich” through what John _sees and feels_, not exposition.

## Scene 4 — THE GIFT CHAIN (tightened, ~1,000; no palace scene)

- **Setting:** Merchant custody → official transfer documents → transport order
    
- **John’s goal:** Stay alive through transfers; understand power; spot leverage.
    
- **Opposition:** Politics-as-ownership; legality as cage.
    
- **Turn:** Paper becomes stronger than chains (harder to kill, harder to free).
    
- **Exit hook:** Transport to Casil’s tower begins.
    

**Beats**

1. Merchant behavior is telling: John is treated as a high-value asset, not a threat.
    
2. Transfer #1: merchant gifts John to the Planetary Governor as political favor.
    
3. John watches status in motion—guards defer, clerks matter, seals matter more.
    
4. Transfer #2: Governor gifts John to Casil to curry favor with a powerful Archmage.
    
5. The “property” language lands—precise, legal, cold.
    
6. Paper trail is created (signatures/seals/witnesses) that complicates future outcomes.
    
7. John realizes the trap: this documentation protects him from casual disposal _and_ legitimizes captivity.
    
8. Transport arranged (flying ship or teleportation).
    

**Rules check**

- Keep it brisk: this scene is momentum + legal stakes, not scenery.
    

---

## Scene 5 — THE TOWER (Arrival & Language Spell) (~2,000)

- **Setting:** Wilderness approach → tower interior → Casil’s study
    
- **John’s goal:** Survive first contact; conceal what he can; read the predator.
    
- **Opposition:** Casil’s power + forced magic intrusion
    
- **Turn:** Casil keeps him and overwrites language the brutal way.
    
- **Exit hook:** Blackout after excruciating pain.
    

**Beats**

1. First glimpse: isolated tower, beautiful/ominous; no nearby settlements.
    
2. Approach feels monitored—silence too clean, nature too careful.
    
3. **Clarified “see vs sense”:** John can **see** physical defenses—carved channels, repeating runic geometry, faint shimmer-lines in the air where light bends, constructs or “maintenance” movement patterns. He can’t interpret them like a mage, but he can read intent. What he can only **sense** is bodily: pressure changes, skin-crawl, the feeling of being watched with tools he doesn’t have.
    
4. Brought into Casil’s study—controlled environment, curated like a laboratory.
    
5. Casil examines him with magical senses (void affinity, no mana circuits, injured but functional).
    
6. John stays still; gives nothing away; refuses to perform.
    
7. Casil decides to keep him (research subject + curiosity).
    
8. Language spell preparation reads as routine—like washing hands before surgery.
    
9. Spell is cast directly into John’s brain.
    
10. Unadapted nervous system seizes under the mana surge—true exposure, not ambient.
    
11. Pain overwhelms thought; John’s last coherent conclusion is simple: _This world doesn’t ask permission._
    
12. Blackout.
    

**Rules check**

- John is “unevolved” (no mana circuits), so direct casting is traumatic and dangerous.

## Scene 6 — THE ACCEPTANCE (~500)

- **Setting:** Final conscious sliver before darkness
    
- **Turn:** Psychological pivot: “already dead” → freedom to adapt.
    

**Beats**

1. The ship is destroyed.
    
2. The unit is gone.
    
3. Rescue is impossible.
    
4. He’s already dead in the void between stars.
    
5. Everything after is borrowed time.
    
6. So why not learn to break reality with his hands?
    

If you want, next I’ll draft **Scene 1** straight into prose using these revised beats.
