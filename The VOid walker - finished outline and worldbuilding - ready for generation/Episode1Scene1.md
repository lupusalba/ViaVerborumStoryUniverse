The red alert didn’t so much start as _arrive_—a rising tone that cut through the ship’s normal hum and rearranged everyone’s priorities in a single breath.

John was already moving before the first cycle finished.

He pushed off the ladderwell and hit the corridor at a jog that never became a sprint. Sprinting made you loud. Sprinting made you sloppy. Sprinting made you fall when the deck jumped.

“Bravo, stack on me,” he said into his throat mic. “Delta, rear. No hero angles.”

Static answered him—thin, ugly. Not total loss, but enough that words came back torn at the edges.

He checked the corridor with a glance that counted without looking like it counted: door seams, ceiling access, fire suppression nozzles, the emergency bulkhead line halfway down the hall. White paint, gray striping, the familiar Human Alliance utilitarian look. The kind of place you could fight in because you understood it.

That was the last comforting thought he got.

Boots thudded behind him. His team came in tight—five bodies he trusted to move when he breathed. Faces in visors, rifles up, muzzles steady. They didn’t ask questions. They didn’t need to. The ship was screaming and something had breached.

John palmed the emergency panel by the bulkhead seam and popped it open with the heel of his hand. The access cavity was empty except for cabling and a junction block.

“Delta, plug a cam if you’ve got one,” he said.

“I’m dry,” Delta’s voice came back clipped.

“Then eyes only.”

He pointed without looking. “Bravo, left doors. Charlie, right. Delta, watch our six. Nobody crosses my muzzle.”

They flowed into positions as if the corridor had been built for this exact moment. It had, in a way. The Alliance trained for boarders. For pirates. For raids. For anything that moved like a human and believed in bullets.

John took one knee behind a corner that gave him line-of-sight down the straight run. His rifle settled into his shoulder. The stock pressed into bone. Good. He wanted the truth through the weapon.

A tremor ran through the deck, not from impact but from something deeper—a change in the ship’s behavior, like a muscle spasm.

“Status?” he asked.

No answer. Comms were degrading. Either the bridge was gone, or something was chewing the network from inside.

He breathed once, slow, to keep his heart out of his hands. The ship’s lighting flickered and came back a shade dimmer.

Then the corridor ahead did something it wasn’t allowed to do.

It didn’t warp like metal under heat. It didn’t buckle. It simply… _felt wrong_.

The straight line of the deck plating seemed to bend without moving. The far end of the hall looked farther and closer at the same time. His eyes tried to focus and couldn’t find a stable target. The air turned metallic and sweet, like blood in a mouth and ozone from a fried circuit. A pressure crawled behind his teeth, a fine static that made him want to grind his jaw until it cracked.

“Hold,” he said, even though nobody had moved.

A shadow stepped out of a corner that was too shallow to hide anything larger than a toolbox.

It didn’t emerge so much as _resolve_, like an image finishing loading.

John fired three rounds on reflex. Controlled burst. Center mass.

The rounds struck…and the impacts didn’t behave. No sparks. No splatter. No thunk against armor. For a fraction of a second, there was a clean _absence_ where his rounds should have hit—like the universe had blinked and forgotten to draw a piece of matter.

Then the absence filled back in.

His throat tightened. His body knew the word _impossible_ before his mind allowed it.

“Contact,” he said, and his voice came out steadier than he felt. “Front.”

The thing—enemy, boarder, whatever it was—moved.

Not fast, exactly. Just… with no wasted time. No acceleration he could read. It slid from one position to another like a chess piece obeying a rule John didn’t know.

Bravo opened up. Muzzles flashed. The corridor filled with the harsh stutter of rifles, the smell of propellant, the bright, familiar violence of rounds in flight.

The enemy didn’t flinch.

It didn’t dodge, either.

It simply didn’t _care_ the way a human would care.

John’s sight picture shimmered. The air in front of his muzzle bent and softened, as if the hall had become heat haze. He adjusted, fired again, walked his shots across where the target should be.

His rounds passed through the haze and did something wrong at the far end—trajectory bending a fraction, like they were being nudged aside by a hand that wasn’t visible.

“Fall back to bulkhead line,” John snapped. “Two steps. Keep fire. Keep spacing.”

They moved like they’d rehearsed it, because they had.

Delta’s rear call came in, tight. “Rear’s clear—”

The word snapped into a burst of static. The tone of it changed, went sharp, then clipped out.

John didn’t turn his head. He didn’t have to. The way Delta’s sentence died told him enough.

“Delta?” John said.

No answer.

Another tremor ran through the deck. Something heavy impacted two levels down. Somewhere, metal screamed.

The enemy advanced into the kill funnel anyway.

John had set the funnel to punish a rush, but this wasn’t a rush. It was a steady approach through fire like the fire was a suggestion.

Bravo yelled—raw, involuntary—and his muzzle dipped for half a second.

John grabbed the back of Bravo’s plate carrier and yanked him into alignment. “Eyes on,” he said, hard. “Breathe. Now.”

Bravo’s breathing hitched, then steadied. The rifle came back up. Good.

The corridor lighting flickered again. For a heartbeat, John saw the enemy’s outline clearer: tall, narrow, wrapped in something that drank light. A face that didn’t resolve. A suggestion of limbs where they should be.

Then the haze returned and the outline didn’t matter.

Something _pressed_ on John’s senses. Not sound. Not light. Pressure. Like the space between his ribs had grown heavier.

His teeth hurt.

He aimed and fired anyway. His finger did what it was trained to do. His brain refused to waste time on naming the unknown.

A pulse rolled down the corridor—no visible source, just a shift in the air that made the hairs on his arms lift under his sleeve.

Charlie’s cover—an alcove, a structural column—_lost definition_. The hard edge blurred, then seemed to be in two places at once. Charlie fired, stepped to adjust—

—and his foot didn’t land where the deck was.

He lurched sideways, catching himself on a wall that wasn’t where his hand expected it. His rifle snapped off two shots into nothing.

John’s stomach flipped.

“Anchor!” John barked. “Back to me. Use the bulkhead seam. Touch steel.”

It was instinct, but it was a good one. The only stable reference was the ship itself. He needed his people tied to something real.

Charlie dragged himself back, palm against the bulkhead line like it was a rope.

John’s mind ran the problem like a checklist.

Unknown boarders.  
Unknown field effect.  
Comms failing.  
Deck integrity compromised.

Win condition? Not victory. Not here.

Survival.

He toggled the local bulkhead override. The panel lights flickered, then stabilized. The door mechanism whined as if it didn’t want to obey.

“Bravo, smoke?” John asked.

“Two,” Bravo said.

“Drop one forward. Make them work.”

Bravo tossed a canister. It clinked, rolled, and popped with a hiss. White smoke billowed down the corridor, thick and fast, swallowing the far end into a blur.

Smoke usually helped. It broke sightlines. It bought seconds.

The smoke did something wrong.

It didn’t roll naturally. It made shapes that weren’t caused by airflow. It pulled into thin strands as if drawn toward invisible points. Some of it fell _up_ for a moment, then corrected. John watched it and felt the skin between his shoulder blades tighten.

Not tech. Not any tech he’d trained against.

“Delta, sound off,” he said again, and this time he allowed himself a quick glance over his shoulder.

Their rear position was empty.

The corridor behind them was still. Lights normal. No bodies.

Delta was simply gone.

John’s throat went dry. The only thing worse than a dead man was a missing one. A missing one meant the enemy could take you without leaving evidence.

He forced his eyes forward. If he stared at the absence, he’d start imagining hands in the walls.

The smoke thinned in a line down the center of the corridor, like something had walked through it and pushed the air aside without touching it.

John fired into the line.

A shape resolved again—closer now. Too close.

A second pulse hit, sharper than the first. The air in the corridor _clicked_, like a pressure seal engaging.

John’s visor display glitched. For half a second, his HUD inverted colors—white became black, black became white—then snapped back.

That wasn’t a system bug. That was the world being told to behave differently.

“Back!” he shouted. “Bulkhead, now!”

They retreated in practiced steps, rifles still firing. John was last, because he always was. The corridor behind them narrowed as the bulkhead doors began to descend.

The enemy moved faster.

It didn’t charge. It _arrived_ at the threshold in the time it took the bulkhead to drop a meter.

John put rounds into it until his magazine clicked empty. The click sounded too loud.

He swapped mags without looking. He was halfway through the motion when pain lanced through his right arm.

It wasn’t a bullet impact the way he knew bullets. There was no slam. No burn. It felt like his arm had been seized by a cold hand and _twisted_ from the inside.

His fingers spasmed. The rifle nearly slipped.

He sucked air through his teeth and clamped down on the scream that wanted out.

The pain wasn’t just pain. It was a message: your limb is no longer yours.

He forced his hand to close around the grip. His fingers obeyed, slow and clumsy.

Nerve hit. Fine motor gone.

John shifted the rifle to his left shoulder in one smooth move—ugly, but functional. He’d trained left-handed. Everyone trained left-handed. The day you needed it, it was already too late to learn.

The bulkhead door slammed down the last meter, sealing the corridor with a metallic finality. The ship shuddered as the seal locked.

For three seconds, there was nothing but their breathing and the distant scream of the ship dying elsewhere.

John stared at the bulkhead seam and waited for it to be cut, melted, phased, or simply told it wasn’t a door anymore.

It held.

Bravo’s voice, thin: “Sir—your arm.”

“Later,” John said.

Charlie swallowed audibly. “Delta’s—”

“Later,” John repeated, sharper. He didn’t allow the loss into the open air. Not yet. Not here.

He forced his right hand to flex. Two fingers moved. The rest trembled, uncooperative. Pain pulsed up into his shoulder, bright and clean.

“Move,” he said. “We can’t sit. Find another fallback.”

They moved down the corridor away from the sealed bulkhead, boots sliding on a deck that now had a faint vibration to it—like the ship was under constant stress. Emergency signage blinked. The overhead lights were on their last patience.

John listened for footsteps behind the bulkhead.

Nothing.

That was worse than something.

They reached an intersection. Four corridors. A maintenance hatch. A sign for EVA lockers.

John stopped, lifted his left hand, and signaled.

“Options,” Bravo said, almost whispering.

John checked his HUD. Map overlay lagged. Corridor labels flickered. He couldn’t trust it.

He looked at the ceiling. The vents.

He looked at the deck. The seams. The way the plating met the walls.

If the enemy could bend space, vents didn’t matter. If the enemy could _take_ someone from behind without opening a door, corridors didn’t matter. Everything was a suggestion.

He hated that thought. He shoved it away.

He chose based on what he _could_ control.

“EVA lockers,” he said. “Get suits. Get tools. Anything with mass and edges.”

Charlie blinked. “Suits?”

“We’ll need them if hull goes. We’ll need them if we have to go outside. We’ll need them if we have to depressurize a corridor and buy time. Move.”

They pushed into the EVA locker bay. White cabinets. Hanging suits. Magnetic clamps. Familiar.

John’s left hand hauled a suit down. His right hand tried to help and failed, fingers twitching like they belonged to someone else.

Bravo saw it and didn’t comment. He just took the suit and worked faster.

They suited up in half the time a drill would allow, because fear made hands fast when discipline kept them accurate.

John latched his helmet, sealed it, listened to the hiss of pressure equalizing. His breathing sounded loud inside the shell.

Comms inside the suit were cleaner, but still shredded at the edges.

A new sound filtered through: a distant, low _tone_ that hadn’t been there before. Not the ship. Not alarms. Something like… resonance. Like a note held by a throat that wasn’t human.

John’s eyes went to the locker bay door.

The corridor beyond looked normal.

Too normal.

He felt the static crawl under his teeth again.

“Contact likely,” he said. “Weapons up.”

They stepped out.

The corridor outside had shifted. Not physically—walls were still walls, lights still lights—but the sense of distance was off. The far intersection looked closer than it should. The air tasted sweet metal even through suit filters.

John moved first, because he could feel his people behind him reading his shoulders for calm.

He rounded the corner—

—and the world _skipped_.

Not like a stumble. Like a missing frame in a recording. One heartbeat he was at the corner, the next he was two meters past it with no memory of crossing the space between.

His stomach lurched. His brain tried to fill the gap with imagined motion and failed.

Charlie cursed. Bravo said, “What the—”

“Eyes on,” John snapped. “Don’t think about it.”

He hated the words as he spoke them, because he knew they were insufficient. You couldn’t command someone not to think when the universe was misbehaving.

The enemy was there. Not blocking the corridor. Just… present, like it had always been present and John was only now allowed to notice.

John fired.

The shots went out. Muzzle flash lit the corridor in strobing bursts. The rounds hit—

—and the impacts again turned into that clean, wrong _absence_.

The enemy lifted a hand. Not a dramatic gesture. A minimal motion, like flipping a switch.

The pressure in John’s suit spiked. His ears popped. The suit’s internal alarms chirped once, confused.

His right arm pain flared so bright it made his vision tunnel.

Charlie’s rifle clattered to the deck. His hands went to his helmet, fingers scrabbling at the seal like he could claw his way out of the pressure.

Bravo stepped forward, trying to drag Charlie back.

John grabbed Bravo’s harness with his left hand and yanked him hard. “Don’t break formation!”

Bravo’s visor turned toward him, wide-eyed. “Charlie’s—”

“Charlie stays alive if we stay alive,” John said, and it tasted like betrayal.

He hated that too. But a dead team saved no one.

John switched tactics.

He stopped trying to kill what wouldn’t die. He started trying to _deny_.

He fired at the floor. At the lights. At the junction panels. He aimed for anything that could change conditions—darkness, smoke, sudden depressurization. He tried to make the corridor hostile to _everything_.

A ceiling panel burst. Sparks showered. The lights dimmed and then failed entirely.

Emergency strips along the deck kicked in, painting everything in low red.

In the red light, the enemy’s outline was clearer—not because it wanted to be, but because the ship’s systems were simpler. Less to bend. Less to manipulate.

It looked like a person wrapped in a moving shadow. It _could_ have been a person. That was the most unsettling part. The shape was familiar enough to trigger recognition, and alien enough to make recognition feel like a trap.

John heard movement behind him.

He spun left-handed, rifle sweeping—

Empty corridor.

Then a whisper of sound like cloth moving, close to his ear.

He didn’t turn his head. He drove backward with his shoulder and fired blind into the space behind him.

The rounds hit something this time—_thud_—and the corridor echoed with it.

A sharp, high sound followed, almost like glass singing.

Charlie screamed.

John risked a glance.

Charlie was on his knees, hands locked to his helmet. The helmet seal line was frosting from the inside as if the temperature had dropped suddenly. His suit’s pressure alarm was now a steady howl.

John’s mind snapped to a conclusion that chilled him: the enemy wasn’t trying to wipe them. It was trying to _break_ them. Separate. Isolate. Take.

“Charlie!” John barked. “Look at me. Hands down. Breathe.”

Charlie didn’t. His scream was animal, caught and helpless.

Bravo moved to help again.

John grabbed him again. “No,” he said. “No. We move.”

Bravo’s jaw clenched. For a second, John thought he’d disobey.

Then Bravo looked past John at the corridor, at the shadow that shouldn’t be able to exist, and fear won. Discipline held, but fear won.

They moved.

John kept them moving because movement was the only thing he could still control.

They reached another intersection. This one opened into a wider passage—closer to the ship’s core.

The deck trembled harder. The ship was losing, systems at a level John couldn’t fix with bullets.

His suit HUD flashed: **ATMOSPHERIC SEAL FAILURE — DECK 7**.

They were on Deck 9.

Two decks down, the ship was opening like a wound.

John’s mind did what it always did under pressure: it calculated the odds without emotion.

They had no comms to coordinate.  
No clear evac route.  
An enemy that ignored physics.  
A ship dying around them.

There was no win here.

Only the choice of _how_ they lost.

John slowed, raised his left hand, and signaled a halt. Bravo stopped. The other two—what was left of them—stopped too. Their breathing filled the private comm channel, harsh and too loud.

John forced himself to look at each visor. To register that these were people, not pieces on a board.

Then he made the call.

“We’re done,” he said.

Bravo’s head snapped up. “Sir?”

John kept his voice flat. Command voice. The voice that made reality for the people who had to obey it.

“They want captures,” John said. “If they wanted bodies, we’d be bodies.”

“You don’t know that,” Bravo shot back, too fast.

John nodded once. “I do.”

He could feel it. In the way Delta had vanished clean. In the way Charlie had been _targeted_ for panic. In the way the enemy approached like it had time.

John swallowed against the metallic sweetness in the air.

“We surrender,” he said.

Silence.

Then Bravo, barely contained: “No.”

John looked at him. “You want to die for a corridor?”

Bravo’s fists clenched. His rifle trembled a fraction.

John continued, because he had to. “We live. We learn. We find the rules. We break them later.”

That last part was impulse, not plan. It was the only way to make surrender sound like anything but defeat.

Bravo stared at him for a long second.

Then his shoulders sagged by a millimeter.

“Fuck,” Bravo said quietly.

John nodded. “Yeah.”

He stepped forward into the wider passage, rifle held low but ready. He raised his empty right hand as high as his damaged arm allowed—pain lancing, fingers refusing to open fully.

He forced them anyway.

In the red emergency lighting, his gloved hand looked black.

He let the rifle slide from his left hand and clatter to the deck. The sound was loud, final, and for a moment he wanted to snatch it back like a reflex.

He didn’t.

Behind him, Bravo’s rifle hit the deck next. Then another.

John kept his posture straight. Not defiant. Not pleading. Controlled. Valuable. Dangerous if mishandled.

The air shifted.

The pressure behind his teeth intensified until his gums ached.

The enemy appeared at the far end of the passage like it had been there the entire time and John’s brain had simply been prevented from seeing it.

It moved closer.

Not fast. Not slow. Just inevitable.

John watched its hands. Its feet. The way it distributed weight—if it had weight. He watched for the moment it would strike.

It didn’t strike.

Something cold snapped around his wrists.

Not metal. Not exactly. The restraints looked like dark bands, matte and featureless, but the sensation was wrong—like pressure applied from inside his bones outward. They tightened until his suit read a brief spike and then stabilized.

His right arm screamed in protest. His fingers went numb entirely.

Bravo made a sound behind him. A choke, half rage, half fear.

John didn’t turn.

Another band snapped around his upper arms, pinning them close. A third settled around his chest. He could still breathe, but the restraints told him the limits of his body with absolute certainty.

John’s mind ticked through one last checklist.

Alive.  
Conscious.  
Captured.

The ship groaned again, deep and dying.

John stared down the corridor into the red light and kept his face blank, because if he showed anything—anger, fear, grief—the enemy would learn what buttons to press.

The shadow-wrapped figure leaned closer, as if listening to his heartbeat through the suit.

John didn’t give it the satisfaction of speeding up.

He breathed once, slow.

And let the loss become something he could carry.
