if your life was a video game, ask yourself this

Wolud you make your character sit on bthe bed and scroll for hours

or would you send him outside to expolore learn level up and unlock new parts of the map

you already know the answer.

no one opens a game hoping the character stayes stuck in the sam room evary day
