Act as an expert Science Fiction/Noir Author and Showrunner. We are writing a 5-Episode Interactive Miniseries for an adult male audience (20–45).

The Story Pitch:
## 1. The Wetwire Job

- **Genre:** Cyberpunk Noir
    
- **The Logline:** A data smuggler must cross a hostile, gang-controlled sector to deliver a decryption key stored in his own brain, but the data is a virus that is deleting his memories minute by minute.
    
- **The "TikTok" Visual Hook:** A POV shot in a dirty bathroom mirror where the protagonist’s reflection glitches into digital static while blood drips from his nose.
    
- **The Episode 1 "Paywall" Cliffhanger:** The protagonist reaches the safehouse, but when the door opens, he stares blankly at his partner—the virus has just deleted the memory of who she is, and she thinks he's turned traitor.
    
- **The Twist (Ep 3):** The data he is carrying isn't a weapon or stolen credits—it is a backup of his own personality from before he became a criminal, commissioned by his estranged wife to "overwrite" the man he has become.

>     
> 3. **Show, Don't Tell:** Focus on sensory details (neon lights reflected in rain, the smell of ozone, the grit of concrete).
>     
> 4. **Format:** This is an interactive story. At the end of every episode, provide 2 distinct choices for the reader that determine the path of the next episode.
