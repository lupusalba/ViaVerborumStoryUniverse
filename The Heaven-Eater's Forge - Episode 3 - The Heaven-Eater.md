# Episode 3: The Heaven-Eater

**1. The Ascent**

Orion Vane flew toward the ceiling of the world.

The atmospheric pressure was crushing, a physical weight that tried to smear him back against the earth. The air was thick with static; sparks danced along his skin, and the hair on his arms stood straight up, reaching for the charge above.

Inside the chrome ribcage clamped to his chest, the souls of his uncles spoke.

_"Steady, lad,"_ Goran’s voice rumbled, vibrating through Orion’s bones. _"Keep your guard up. Don't let the pressure buckle your knees."_

_"Heart rate is spiking,"_ Silas’s voice cut in, cool and clinical. _"One hundred and eighty beats per minute. Focus on your breathing. You are not the target; you are the conduit. Let the mechanism do the work."_

Orion looked up. The violet clouds were swirling, a vortex of annihilation miles wide. He felt small. He felt like an insect flying into a furnace.

"I can feel it watching me," Orion whispered. The wind whipped the words away, but the Battery heard him.

_"It doesn't hate you,"_ Silas replied. _"It is simply offended. It is the ocean offended that a cup is trying to hold it. Prove it wrong."_

The swirling stopped. In the center of the storm, the clouds parted. An eye opened—a pupil of blinding, incandescent purple.

"Here it comes!" Orion screamed.

**2. The First Tribulation**

The sky didn't throw a bolt; it dropped a pillar.

A column of violet light the width of a city block slammed down. It was a solid wall of energy, hot enough to turn sand into glass and loud enough to deafen the world.

Orion vanished inside it.

The Aether-Vortex Battery screamed to life. The central sphere spun so fast it became a blur of silver.

Inside the mechanism, Goran and Silas worked with frantic precision. They met the onrushing flood of Divine Will—the command to _cease existing_—and shredded it. They tore the judgment away from the energy, filtering the divine hatred out and leaving only the pure, raw mana.

They fed that mana directly into Orion’s heart.

Orion threw his head back and roared. It wasn't a scream of pain; it was the sound of a vessel being overfilled. His skin blackened and cracked like dried mud. Underneath, new flesh glowed violet. His bones shattered, turning to dust, and reformed instantly—denser, etched with natural runes.

He wasn't surviving the lightning. He was metabolizing the apocalypse.

The second strike hit. Then the third.

Each one was heavier than the last, but each one found a stronger vessel.

When the third strike faded, Orion was still floating there. He was smoking, his clothes burned away to the waist, but he was alive. The Primordial Mana Body was waking up, hungry for more.

**3. The Double Tribulation**

The sky paused.

The clouds churned, confused. The target should be ash. The target was still there, and it was... stronger?

Heaven realized the artifact was cheating. The Battery was a semi-divine existence, a thing of souls and god-metal. It was not a tool; it was an entity.

The clouds split. **Two eyes opened.**

One for the boy. One for the machine.

_"Escalation detected!"_ Silas’s voice lost its calm. _"It’s targeting the Battery as a separate entity. Combined tribulation logic applies. Exponential increase. Nine strikes total!"_

Strikes four, five, and six fell simultaneously.

They didn't just hit Orion; they tried to tear the Battery off his chest. The force was unimaginable.

_"Too much!"_ Silas yelled. _"The intake valves are redlining! We can't filter two streams at once!"_

Orion looked at the unfiltered lightning arcing toward the exposed machinery. If the Battery broke, his uncles died.

Orion didn't hide. He didn't rely on the filter. He reached out with his bare hands and grabbed the raw, unfiltered bolt of judgment.

He pulled the Divine Will into his own body.

It ravaged him. It was acid for the soul. It tore at his mind, screaming _YOU SHOULD NOT BE._

But the Battery responded. It took the purified mana from the other stream and pumped it into the damage, healing him as fast as he was being destroyed. It was a loop of destruction and creation—death and rebirth in the space between heartbeats, a thousand lifetimes compressed into seconds.

The heat was so intense the chrome of the Battery began to melt. It didn't drip; it fused. The metal ribcage sank into Orion’s skin, merging with his flesh. The sphere became his sternum.

Goran and Silas were no longer voices in a machine. They were whispers in his blood.

---

**4. The Feeding**

Heaven poured everything into the end.

Strikes seven, eight, and nine did not fall separately. They fell as a single, continuous event. The universe collapsed inward, all weight and pressure and inevitability focusing on one coordinate.

Orion should have been dust. He should have been a memory.

Instead, he opened his mouth.

He inhaled.

The Aether-Vortex engaged its primary function. It created a vacuum—not of air, but of mana.

_WOOSH._

The sound was inverted—an implosion of silence.

The violet column began to thin. The lightning wasn't pushing down anymore; it was being pulled in. Orion was drinking the storm.

The clouds turned gray. Then white. Then transparent.

The storm didn't fade away. It was sucked dry.

---

**5. The Transformation**

Sunlight broke through.

Orion hovered in the empty sky. He was changed.

He was six inches taller. His hair was gone, burned away by the final, arrogant intake of power. His skin was no longer flesh; it was polished marble, white and flawless. Where the Battery had been, silver tattoos now traced the lines of his ribs and sternum.

He opened his eyes. The sclera were black as void, the irises faceted gemstones of glowing violet.

He looked at his hands. He flexed his fingers, and the air around them rippled.

He looked up at the empty, blue sky.

He bowed. It was a stiff, mocking bow.

Then he dropped. He didn't fall; he descended, landing softly beside Kael on the ramparts.

---

**6. The Aftermath**

Heat radiated off Orion like a kiln. The stone beneath his feet cracked from the thermal shock.

Orion touched his bald head self-consciously. He looked at Kael with eyes that were too old, too powerful, but the boy was still in there, somewhere behind the gems.

"I thought I'd already won," Orion murmured, his voice sounding like grinding stones. "I got arrogant on the last one. The ancestors would laugh."

Kael looked at his son. He looked at the monster they had built to save him.

**"The scar remains so the lesson does,"** Kael said softly. **"Wear it."**

He pulled Orion into a hug, ignoring the static shock that snapped against his skin, ignoring the heat that singed his clothes.

_Six months,_ Kael thought, holding his transformed son. _I have six months to make sure he can lead without me._

"You did it," Kael whispered.

Across the plains, the Scrying Eyes of the empires watched. They saw the marble skin. They saw the violet eyes. They knew a new apex predator had just been born.

**7. The Toast**

That evening, the Great Hall was quiet.

There was no raucous party. There was only the somber pride of survivors.

At the center of the high table, two chairs were empty. Places were set for Elder Goran and Elder Silas. The plates were untouched.

A young woman—Goran's granddaughter—stared at the empty chair, jaw clenched. An elderly mage—Silas's research partner—traced the rim of an untouched wine glass, silent tears falling.

Kael stood at the head of the table. His hand trembled as he raised his glass. The white streak in his hair had spread, covering half his head now.

**"To the Forge,"** Kael said.

The family rose as one, hundreds of voices echoing in the stone hall. **"To the Forge."**

Orion sat at his father's right hand. He ate ravenously, clearing plate after plate. His new metabolism demanded fuel. He didn't speak, but every time he looked at the empty chairs, his violet eyes dimmed.

---

**8. The Departure**

"Patriarch."

Aunt Lysa approached the table. She looked tired but fierce. "Report from the perimeter. Every major power is sending envoys. They will be here by dawn. Some bear tribute, others demand explanations. They are all terrified."

Kael nodded. He reached into his coat and pulled out a Master Control Keystone. It pulsed with a dull blue light.

"Engage the Dimensional Drive," Kael said. "Randomize the coordinates. Somewhere cold this time."

"And the envoys?"

"Let them find a hole in the ground."

The estate began to hum. The vibration shook the wine in the glasses. Outside, the view of the plains began to waver, reality loosening its grip.

Orion wiped his mouth. He looked at the distortion in the windows.

"If they have complaints," Orion said, "the sky knows where to find me."

Kael grinned. It was a weak, tired grin, but it was real.

The Vane Estate flickered. It turned transparent. And then, with a thunderclap that displaced the air for miles, it vanished.

It left only a crater and a legend.

**9. Epilogue**

**Scene A: The Vault**

Days later, deep in the new location—a frozen tundra in the far north—Orion descended into the Family Vault.

The Battery was gone from his chest, physically integrated into his being, but the consciousness remained.

Orion placed his hand on the smooth marble of his own sternum.

_"You did well, lad,"_ Goran’s voice whispered in his mind. _"Your form was sloppy on the seventh strike, but you didn't quit."_

_"The transformation is stable,"_ Silas added. _"You are no longer mortal, Orion. Your biology has shifted to a mana-based substrate. Congratulations... and condolences."_

"Thank you," Orion said to the quiet room. "Both of you. I won't waste what you gave."

Silence stretched for a moment. Then, a warm feeling spread through his chest.

_"We know,"_ Goran said. _"You're a Vane."_

**Scene B: The Realization**

In his private chamber, Kael stood before a mirror.

He unbuttoned his shirt. The skin over his heart was gray and cracked, looking like shattered glass held together by will alone.

He tried to channel a simple cantrip. He coughed, and blood splattered the mirror.

"Six months," he whispered to his reflection. "Maybe less."

He looked at the portrait on the wall—a painting of a young Orion, smiling and human, before the marble and the weight of the world took him.

Kael smiled. It was a small, broken thing.

"Worth it."

**Scene C: The Research**

One week later.

Orion sat in the depths of the Restricted Archives. He was surrounded by towers of ancient texts. He hadn't slept in three days. He didn't need to anymore.

His eyes were wild with determination.

He turned the page of the Progenitor's final journal, finding a hidden addendum tucked into the back binding.

_Soul damage from temporal artifacts is absolute... save for one exception. The Sap of the World Tree, heart of the Primordial Forest, can mend even sundered souls. But the tree is hidden in the heart of the Primordial Wildlands, beyond the edges of the known world, where even dragons fear to tread._

Orion stared at the passage. He traced the words with a marble finger.

He closed the book slowly. The _thump_ echoed in the silence.

He stood up, his jaw set.

**"Then I'll find it."**

**Scene D: Final Image**

Cut to the Great Desolate Plains.

The sun rose over the crater where the Vane Estate had once stood. The earth was scorched, glassed by the energy of the departure.

But in the absolute center of the destruction, a single flower was growing—a silver-petaled bloom that only grew in the Vane Estate gardens. A seed, carried on the wind of their departure.

Life was returning. **The Vanes left their mark.**

Far above, in the high atmosphere, the clouds flickered violet once.

It wasn't a strike. It wasn't anger. It was watchfulness.

Balance remained.

For now.
