NAME: Magic System
ROLE: magic_system
OTHER NAMES: Ambient energy, mana current, elemental mana
SOURCE OF MAGIC: - Mana is omnipresent environmental energy in Inner Universe

- Exists in "gaseous" state normally (can condense to crystals under extreme pressure)

- Source unknown (even to 9th-circle mages—fundamental force of universe)

- Does not deplete (when beings die, mana returns to environment or forms crystals)

- Flows through everything like invisible current
WHO CAN USE MAGIC: 1. Mages (born with mana pool—internal organ that stores/channels mana)

    - Rare: ~10-20% of population born with mana pool

    - Nobility has higher rate (~60-80%) due to bloodline

    - Requires talent (sensitivity, affinity, absorption capability)



2. Knights (no mana pool required—use mana core formed through cultivation)

    - Common: ~80% of population can become knights

    - Lower talent threshold

    - Form mana core in body through systematic training



3. Beasts (absorb mana passively into body/body parts)

    - All magic beasts absorb mana automatically

    - No conscious cultivation needed (instinctual)

    - Store mana in body parts (scales, claws, organs)
SCHOOLS OR TYPES OF MAGIC: 

- Elemental Affinities (Common):

    - Fire (offensive, destruction)

    - Water (healing, flexibility)

    - Earth (defense, stability)

    - Air/Wind (speed, mobility)



- Rare Affinities:

    - Light (healing, purification, holy magic)

    - Darkness (concealment, curses, shadow magic)

    - Space (teleportation, dimensional magic—VERY RARE, ~1% of mages)

    - Time (theoretical—no confirmed practitioners)



- Affinity Effects:

    - Lowers mana cost for element spells (more efficient)

    - Easier absorption/refinement of matching mana type

    - Can only cast spells of personal affinity (cross-element impossible)

    - Quality determines mastery speed and power ceiling
HOW MAGIC WORKS:: 

- Mana Absorption (Standard):

    1. Meditate (requires stillness and focus)

    2. Draw ambient mana into body

    3. Refine mana to match affinity (purify, convert)

    4. Store in mana pool

    5. Use stored mana to cast spells



- Spell Casting:

1. BUILD (Internal)

Form spell blueprint inside mana pool

Shape your mana into the pattern

2. PROJECT (External)

Push the magic circle outside your body

Make it visible in the world

3. ACTIVATE (Release)

Release the effect

Maintain it (if needed) or let it expire



- Spell Components:

    - Incantation: Verbal formula (focuses will, structures energy)

    - Magic Circle: Geometric mana pattern (visible, outside body)

    - Mana Thread: Connection between pool and circle




RULES & LIMITATIONS: - Mana Poisoning:

    - Un-evolved beings exposed to mana suffer poisoning

    - Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, disorientation, organ damage, body deterioration, mutation

    - Cause: Body is being transformed and forced to evolve

    - Cure: Complete evolution (adapt body to accept mana)

    - John's case: Human + weak shell + high exposure = 3-5 year death sentence



- Evolution by Mana:

    - All Inner Universe life evolved through mana exposure

    - Un-evolved beings: 98%+ death rate without guidance

    - Evolution stages: 0.0 (baseline) → 1.0 (fully adapted)

    - Extends lifespan, enhances body, unlocks magic potential

    - Process: Slow adaptation (decades naturally) OR forced adaptation (risky)



- Mana Pool Shell:

    - Membrane containing mana within the pool

    - Un-evolved humans have a weak shell (breaks under pressure)

    - Strengthened by forming circles, evolution progress

    - Shell rupture = death (mana floods the body uncontrolled)



- Circle System:

    - Geometric patterns formed around the mana pool

    - Each circle: Compresses mana, strengthens shell, increases capacity

    - Quality affects: Stability, casting speed, efficiency, capacity growth

    - Requires blueprints (mathematical/magical formulas—restricted knowledge)
MANA DISPERSION (JOHN'S INNOVATION / APPLICATION): - Discovery: Reversing absorption (pushes mana OUT instead of IN)

- Effect: Forces micro-adaptations (like muscle breakdown in exercise)

- Benefits:

    - Accelerates evolution (10x faster than passive exposure)

    - Reduces shell pressure (prevents rupture)

    - Enables healing (expelled mana repairs tissue)

    - Can be done while moving (unlike absorption—requires meditation)

- Cost: "Wastes" refined mana (but John doesn't care—survival priority)

- Unique: No other mage uses this (they want to GAIN mana, not lose it)
MULTI-CASTING: - Maintaining multiple spells simultaneously

- Extremely difficult (attention divided)

- Each active spell = mental load (concentration cost)

- Masters can maintain 2-3 spells

- John's method: Subconscious automation (Pocket Dimension runs in background after months of practice)
SPELL CASTING PROCESS (BY INNER CIRCLE LEVEL): ### 1st-3rd Circle Mages (Basic Casters):

1. Form Intent (visualize desired effect)

2. Speak Incantation (optional for masters, but recommended—helps structure mana flow)

3. Construct Magic Circle:

    - Inside mana pool first (blueprint formation, internal structure)

    - Channel mana from pool → Project circle outside body (geometric pattern materializes)

    - Circle appears in air/ground (visible to mana sight)

4. Maintain Connection (mana thread links pool to external circle)

5. Release Effect (spell activates)

6. Spell Duration:

    - Instant (effect occurs once, circle dissolves)

    - Sustained (requires continuous focus, drains mana over time)

    - Until dropped (caster releases intentionally or loses concentration)

Limitation: Uses only personal mana (cannot draw from environment)

---

### 4th-6th Circle Mages (Advanced Casters):

1. Form Intent

2. Speak Incantation (many skip this—experience allows silent casting)

3. Construct Magic Circle:

    - Form blueprint inside mana pool (internal pattern, more complex than 1st-3rd circle)

    - Channel mana → Project circle outside body

    - Key difference: Circle construction happens partially inside pool, partially outside simultaneously (faster formation, more stable structure)

4. Draw Ambient Mana (NEW CAPABILITY):

    - External circle acts as "funnel" (pulls environmental mana into spell)

    - Personal mana = trigger/control (10-30% of total spell cost)

    - Ambient mana = fuel/power (70-90% of spell effect)

    - Result: Far more powerful spells than mana pool alone could produce

5. Maintain & Release (as above)

Advantage: Can cast spells exceeding personal mana capacity by leveraging environment

---

### 7th-9th Circle Mages (Master Casters):

1. Form Intent (often subconscious—experience makes this instantaneous)

2. Incantation (almost never needed—masters shape mana purely through will)

3. Construct Magic Circle:

    - Blueprint forms inside mana pool (extremely complex geometric patterns)

    - Simultaneously construct external circle (no delay between internal/external—seamless)

    - Circle appears fully-formed in <1 second (appears instant to observers)

4. Command Ambient Mana (NOT just "draw"—active control):

    - External circle actively pulls and shapes environmental mana

    - Personal mana = <10% (purely control/direction)

    - Ambient mana = >90% (massive environmental energy)

    - Can pull mana from hundreds of meters radius (war spells affect entire battlefield)

5. Release & Control:

    - Can maintain multiple high-circle spells simultaneously

    - Can modify spell mid-cast (adjust power, change targeting)

    - Duration: Masters can sustain spells for hours/days

Mastery: Magic becomes extension of will—minimal personal cost, maximum environmental leverage
MAGIC CIRCLE: - Appearance: Visible geometric formation (to those with mana sight)

    - Glowing lines/runes arranged in precise mathematical patterns

    - Complexity increases with circle level (1st = simple shapes, 9th = impossibly intricate)

    - Color varies by element (fire = red/orange, water = blue, space = silver/void-black)

- Location: Outside caster's body (projected into air or onto surface)

- Function:

    - Shapes mana into specific structure (determines spell effect)

    - Acts as "lens" or "funnel" (4th+ circle: draws ambient mana)

    - Contains spell until release (prevents premature activation)

- Formation Process:

    - 1st-3rd: Blueprint in pool → Channel mana out → Circle forms (2-3 steps, visible delay)

    - 4th-6th: Blueprint + projection happen simultaneously (1-2 steps, fast)

    - 7th-9th: Instant formation (appears to skip construction phase entirely)
MANA THRED: - Structure: Stream of mana linking caster's pool to external circle

- Function:

    - Channels energy from pool to spell

    - Maintains control (caster directs spell through this link)

    - If severed = spell collapses (enemy disruption, caster loses focus)

- Visibility: Invisible to normal sight, visible to advanced mana detection

- Vulnerability: John exploits this—opens micro-gates to sever threads (spell disruption tactic)
SPELL FAILURE CONDITIONS (ALL LEVELS): 1. Loss of Concentration:

    - Distraction (sudden noise, pain, surprise)

    - Damage to caster (injury disrupts focus)

    - Divided attention (attempting too many spells at once)

    - Result: Circle destabilizes, mana disperses harmlessly (minor failure) OR backlashes into caster (major failure)



2. Insufficient Mana:

    - Pool depleted mid-cast

    - Can't draw enough ambient mana (mana-sparse environment)

    - Result: Spell weakens or fails to form



3. Incorrect Circle Formation:

    - Blueprint error (wrong geometric pattern)

    - Sloppy construction (rushed, imprecise lines)

    - Result: Spell misfires (wrong effect), backlashes (energy rebounds), or fizzles (no effect)



4. External Disruption:

    - Enemy breaks magic circle (physical or magical attack)

    - Mana thread severed (connection cut)

    - Environmental interference (strong opposing magic, mana-dead zone)

    - John's specialty: Opens micro-gates intersecting circle geometry → structure collapses



5. Natural Expiration:

    - Time limit reached (most spells have duration)

    - Caster intentionally drops (ends concentration)

    - Mana exhausted (sustained spells drain over time until pool empty)
JOHN'S INNOVATIONS (EXPLOITING THE SYSTEM): ### Disruption Tactics:

- Micro-Gate Insertion: Opens thumbnail-sized gate intersecting enemy circle

    - Breaks geometric structure (even 1mm displacement = total collapse)

    - Causes backlash (mana rebounds into the enemy caster—painful/dangerous)

    - Works on any circle level (structure is structure, regardless of power)

    - The stronger the circle or caster is, the higher the resistance is for the Micro-Gate to open, and the higher the mana consumption for that Micro-Gate



### Attack and Assassination:

- By forming Micro-Gate close to the enemy, or at an odd angle, and shooting projectiles (throwing knives, blades, magic bullets, etc), John can kill, disable, or disrupt the enemy

- The enemy can strike back through the gate, and the effect of the spell can spill back and harm John.

- John can feel the pressure from the other side of the gate as if he were there

- The stronger the enemy, the bigger the area around them that they can feel - and detect the opening of Micro-Gate or disruption in mana flow, which lowers the  chance of successful attack from John



### Mana Thread Severing:

- Identifies thread location (advanced mana sensitivity from basic exercises)

- Opens the gate to "cut" the thread (connection broken)

- Spell loses control, collapses, or goes wild

-  The stronger the caster is, the higher the resistance is for the Micro-Gate to open, and the higher is mana consumption for that Micro-Gate



### Ambient Mana Disruption:

- For 4th+ circle mages (who partly rely on environmental draw)

- Opens multiple gates around the enemy circle/caster

- Gates "disrupt" ambient mana before the enemy can control it

- Enemy spell weakens dramatically (personal mana only = 10-30% normal power), and much higher chance of backlash and spell feiling
