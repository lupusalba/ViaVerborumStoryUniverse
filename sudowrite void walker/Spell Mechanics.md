NAME:  Spell Mechanics
ROLE: magic_system
OTHER NAMES: Magic circles, spell formations, incantations
WHAT SPELLS ARE: - Mana given specific structure/form

- Triggered by caster's mana pool energy

- Amplified by ambient mana (4th+ circle capability)

- Temporary effect (expires after time or when dropped)
SPELL STRUCTURE: Components:

1. Intent (mental image of desired effect)

2. Incantation (verbal formula—optional for masters)

- Structures mana flow

- Focuses caster's will

- Makes casting easier (training wheels)

3. Magic Circle (geometric mana formation)

- Formed outside body (visible with mana sight)

- Complex patterns (more complex = higher circle spell)

- Blueprint determines structure

4. Mana Thread (connection from pool to circle)

- Channels energy from caster to spell

- Must be maintained (concentration required)

- Formation Process:

1. Caster forms intent (decides what spell does)

2. Speaks incantation (optional, helps structure)

3. Channels mana from pool → Shapes into circle outside body

4. Circle draws ambient mana (4th+ circle only)

5. Effect activates

6. Caster maintains or releases
SPELL CATEGORIES BY CIRCLE LEVEL: 1st Circle (Basic):

- Simple effects (light, heat, movement)

- Small scale (affects 1-2 meters)

- Low mana cost

- Fast casting (seconds)

- Examples: Mini Gate, Fire Bolt, Water Sphere

2nd-3rd Circle (Intermediate):

- Complex effects (barriers, illusions, element manipulation)

- Medium scale (affects 10-20 meters)

- Moderate mana cost

- Medium casting (10-30 seconds)

- Examples: Minor Teleport, Fireball, Ice Wall

4th-6th Circle (Advanced):

- Powerful effects (destruction, large-scale manipulation, transformation)

- Large scale (affects 100+ meters)

- High mana cost (draws ambient mana to supplement)

- Slow casting (minutes for complex spells)

- Examples: Pocket Dimension, Gate, Meteor Strike

7th+ Circle (Master):

- Devastating effects (war spells, strategic magic, reality-warping)

- Massive scale (affects kilometers)

- Enormous mana cost (requires multiple mages or artifacts)

- Very slow casting (can take hours to prepare)

- Examples: War Spell, Forbidden Magic, Region-Scale Attacks
CASTING METHODS: Standard (Most Mages):

- Must meditate/sit for absorption

- Stand still for spell casting

- Single-spell focus (one at a time)

- Incantation required (unless master-level)

Combat Mages (Specialized):

- Can cast while moving (trained skill)

- Faster incantations (shortened formulas)

- Quick-cast minor spells (reflexive)

- Still can't multi-cast (one spell active at a time)

John's Method (Unique/Human):

- Disperses while moving (constant evolution) - Mana Dispersion is a technique, not a spell. Mana Dispersion is reverse application of most fundamental technique - Mana Absorption

- Can cast while moving (military training + dispersion practice)

- Multi-gate deployment (2-4 portal pairs—extreme focus)

- Subconscious spell maintenance (Pocket Dimension automated)

- Silent casting (learned through practice—no incantation needed for Mini Gate)

- Evolved Humans have high potential for multi-casting (if trained)
SPELL FAILURE: Causes:

- Distraction (damage, surprise, divided attention)

- Insufficient mana (ran out mid-cast)

- Incorrect formation (bad circle geometry)

- External disruption (enemy interference)

- Environmental factors (mana-dead zones, strong formations)



Consequences:

- Minor: Spell fizzles (wasted mana, no effect)

- Moderate: Backlash (mana rebounds into caster—painful)

- Severe: Mana pool damage (cracked shell, internal injury)

- Critical: Death (pool rupture, mana detonation)



John's Disruption Tactics:

- Opens micro-gates intersecting enemy circles

- Breaks geometric structure (spell collapses)

- Enemy loses mana + suffers backlash

- John escapes before counter-attack


SPELL DURATION: Instant (Most Combat Spells):

- Effect happens immediately

- No maintenance required

- Examples: Fire Bolt, Lightning Strike, Teleport



Sustained (Concentration Required):

- Effect continues while caster focuses

- Drains mana slowly over time

- Examples: Barriers, Illusions, Floating Platforms

- Drop when: Caster distracted, runs out of mana, chooses to end

Permanent (Until Dispelled):

- Effect embedded in object/location (Magic Formation)

- No ongoing mana cost (after initial casting), or small cost

- Examples: Enchantments, Formations, Artifact Functions

- Very difficult to achieve (requires formation mastery)

John's Pocket Dimension:

- Technically "sustained" (should require constant focus)

- John trained it to "subconscious" (runs automatically)

- Still technically active (if disrupted = death)

- Breakthrough: Making temporary spell permanent through automation

- Body evolving in direction to support Pocket Dimension as part of it.
