**Act 1**: John Silver, a 27-year-old Special Forces officer, awakens in an alien forest after a spatial rift destroys his infiltration ship. Captured by an orc merchant and gifted to Arch Mage Casil—a 7th-circle dark elf researcher—John becomes a research specimen. Casil discovers John is an "impossible" being: un-evolved yet possessing a mana pool with rare space affinity.

Casil's diagnosis is a death sentence: John's weak mana pool shell will rupture within 3-5 years. Absorbing mana accelerates the damage. Casil dismisses John as a failed specimen, assigning him servant duties while conducting occasional experiments.

But John refuses to accept death. Analyzing his situation like a military operation, he discovers that _reversing_ mana cultivation—dispersing instead of absorbing—accelerates evolution while reducing shell pressure. Combining this with physical training and the tower's extensive library, John begins secret advancement far beyond what Casil believes possible.

**Act 2**: Over four years, John masters "basic" magic exercises (considered useless by mages), learns restricted circle blueprints from Casil's library, and develops tactical applications of space magic. When he discovers an incomplete high-level spell—Pocket Dimension—he does the impossible: casts it inside his body, isolating mana from his body and removing mana pressure form his weak mana shell.

Near-death from the attempt, John succeeds through sheer will and military discipline. He develops the Minor Veil to hide his Pocket Dimension and true power, absorbs mana through Mini Gates opened outside the tower (avoiding detection), and reaches 3rd circle with control rivaling 5th-circle mages.

When terrorists launch a coordinated attack on both the tower and Casil's family, forcing Casil to leave to save his son's branch, John defends the tower alone. Using asymmetric warfare—disrupting 7th-circle war spells with micro-portals, assassinating mages with throwing knives through gates, collapsing magical formations—John holds the tower for two hours until Casil returns.

The terrorists flee. Casil attempts to re-enter his tower—and finds himself **locked out**. During the attack, John seized control of the tower's systems, changing the access permissions. Now standing outside his own fortress, Casil faces an impossible situation: his "dying servant" has become the gatekeeper.

**Act 3 Opening** (The Negotiation):

In the standoff that follows, John reveals his true capabilities. He can destroy the tower (self-destruct protocols). Casil's centuries of research, his 7th-grade artifact, his restricted library—all hostage to a 3rd-circle mage he dismissed as a curiosity.

But John doesn't want destruction. He wants **survival**. He forces Casil to swear a magical oath: formal apprenticeship, access to resources, and most critically, **no harm shall come to John by Casil's hand or design**. Casil, recognizing he has no choice and seeing strategic value in studying John's tactical genius, agrees. The oath binds them both.

**Act 3 Middle** (Apprenticeship):

Over the next two to three years, Casil teaches John openly—providing advanced techniques, better resources, and genuine instruction. John advances to 5th circle, his unconventional applications of magic leaving deep impressions on Casil. But the dark elf's initial fascination turns to fear. John doesn't just learn—he **weaponizes**. Every spell becomes a tactical tool. Every principle gets adapted to asymmetric warfare.

Casil realizes the truth: John isn't a mage who happens to know military tactics. He's a **soldier who learned magic**. And that makes him more dangerous than any 7th-circle combat mage.

**Act 3 Climax** (The Betrayal):

Casil finds his loophole: the oath prevents **him** from harming John, but he can "help him", send him to place where he will get better treatment (but he will be a slave). He arranges to trade John to the Royal Magic Tower—claiming it's an "opportunity" for John to advance further. In exchange, Casil receives resources to force his breakthrough to 8th circle. The Tower wants John badly (rare space affinity, unprecedented talent, tactical genius, no affiliation to any group, and practically ownership of John).

John discovers the plot when Casil leaves the tower to finalize the arrangement. Having prepared for betrayal from the moment the oath was sworn, John activates his contingency: the Space Jump Box, built over years and hidden in plain sight as a "research project." He connects it to the tower's ley line power source.

When Casil returns with Royal Tower mages to collect their "prize," John has just seized total control. The tower's defenses activate against them. Casil, standing outside once again, watches helplessly as John activates the incomplete artifact.

**Act 3 Resolution** (The Escape):

The Space Jump Box—imperfect, hastily completed, with randomized destination—does exactly what John designed it to do: **steal the entire tower**. Reality warps. Space tears. The 300-meter magical fortress **vanishes**, teleporting randomly across the planet.

Casil is left standing in empty wilderness, his life's work gone. The Royal Tower mages stare in disbelief. And somewhere, thousands of kilometers away, John Silver stands in the control room of his stolen fortress, alone and free for the first time in seven years.

The oath is technically unbroken—Casil didn't harm John. But John has taken everything Casil had. The student has robbed the master. The prisoner has become the thief.

**Themes**: Human adaptability. Innovation vs tradition. Tactical thinking vs raw power. Freedom through competence. The price of underestimating the "weak."
