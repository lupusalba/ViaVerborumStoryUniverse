NAME: Mage Advancement
ROLE: magic_system
OTHER NAMES: Inner circles, mage circles, cultivation rings
WHAT CIRCLES ARE: - Geometric mana structures formed around mana pool

- Physical manifestation (can be seen with mana sight) if the one looking is of much higher level

- Permanent once formed (unless damaged by external force)

- Each circle = layer of compressed mana forming pattern

- Blueprint = construction template (mathematical formula + mana manipulation)
PROGRESSION LADDER: 1st-3rd Circle (Common Mages):

- Public knowledge (blueprints available to all)

- Most population reaches 3rd circle (talent ceiling)

- Lifespan: +20-50 years per circle (depending on the species)

- Power: Basic spells, local threats



4th-6th Circle (Nobility & Elite):

- Restricted knowledge (Royal Tower controls blueprints)

- Nobility and Tower members get access

- Most nobles stuck at 6th circle (talent limit)

- Lifespan: +50-100 years per circle (depending on the species)

- Power: War mages, commanders, planetary governors



7th-8th Circle (Arch Mages):

- Highly restricted (ancient families, Tower leadership)

- Extreme talent required + resources + luck

- Very few reach 7th (maybe 0.1% of mages)

- Even fewer reach 8th (ancient ancestors in hibernation)

- Lifespan: +200-400 years per circle (depending on the species)

- Power: Strategic assets, family trump cards



9th Circle (Legendary):

- Only 2 confirmed: Emperor, Tower Head

- Likely more in hibernation (hidden trump cards)

- Lifespan: Centuries added

- Power: Planet-destroying capability
ADVANCEMENT BARRIERS: 3→4 Circle (First Major Hurdle):

- Talent filter (separates common from elite)

- Requires: Higher mana control, restricted blueprint, resources

- Failure rate: ~70%

6→7 Circle (Second Major Hurdle):

- Most nobility stuck here (biological talent ceiling)

- Requires: Genius-level talent, decades of refinement, enlightenment

- Casil stuck here for decades

- Failure rate: ~95%

7→8 Circle (Nearly Impossible):

- Requires: Genius + massive resources + fortune + centuries

- Casil's goal (willing to betray John for resources to attempt)

- Failure rate: ~99%

8→9 Circle (Legendary):

- Unknown requirements

- No documented successful advancement (existing 9th circles from ancient times)


CIRCLE QUALITY EFFECTS: High Quality:

- Spell stability (less chance of failure/collapse)

- Faster casting (quicker circle formation)

- Mana efficiency (less waste per spell)

- Greater capacity increase (more mana storage per circle)



Low Quality:

- Unstable spells (higher failure rate)

- Slow casting (sluggish formation)

- Wasteful (burns more mana per effect)

- Minimal capacity gain



John's Advantage:

- Perfect blueprints (Casil's restricted library)

- Superior mana control (basic exercises mastery)

- Result: 5th-circle power with 7th-circle control quality


REQUIREMENTS TO ADVANCE: 

1. Sufficient Mana Quantity: Fill current pool capacity completely

2. Blueprint Knowledge: Mathematical/magical formula for next circle

3. Mana Control: Ability to shape and maintain complex geometric structure

4. Time: Refinement period (stabilize circle, compress mana, integrate)

5. Resources (optional but helpful): Mana crystals, pills, formations
KNOWLEDGE RESTRICTION SYSTEM: Public (1st-3rd): Available in any magic academy, bookstore

Restricted (4th-6th): Royal Tower members, nobility, Tower-approved mages

Forbidden (7th-8th): Ancient families, Tower leadership, high merit

Secret (9th): Unknown (possibly lost, possibly hoarded)

Casil's Access:

- 1st-6th: In main library (Tower member privilege)

- 7th-8th: In private study (family lineage + personal research)

- 9th: Doesn't have (seeking resources to gain access)


ALTERNATIVE METHODS: Self-Development: Some mages attempt creating circles without blueprints

- Extremely dangerous (70%+ death rate)

- Usually inferior quality (unless genius breakthrough)

- Casil tried this for 7→8 (failed repeatedly)



Forced Advancement: Using external resources to push through

- Expensive (massive mana crystals, rare pills, artifacts)

- Lower quality result (rushed formation)

- Casil's plan: Trade John for resources to attempt this
