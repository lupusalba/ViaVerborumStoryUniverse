NAME: Space Jump Box
ROLE: item
OTHER NAMES: Tower Teleporter
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: Crystal box (1 feet x 1 feet x 1 feet) with glowing formations on all surfaces and 4 chains for connecting to the Tower and ley-lines
WHO OWNS THIS ITEM: John
TYPE: Long-range teleportation artifact (John's creation)
PURPOSE: Escape mechanism → Eventually tower theft tool
DESIGN EVOLUTION: - Year 2: Initial concept (theoretical escape plan)

- Year 4-5: Active development (access to materials through apprenticeship)

- Year 6-7: Rush completion (discovered betrayal—needed urgency)
FUNCTION: - Teleports large objects/structures (designed for tower)

- Requires: Massive external power source (ley lines, tower power core)

- Range: Planetary scale (theoretically—untested)
 FLAWS (DUE TO RUSHED COMPLETION): - Incomplete calculations: Destination randomization (can't control where)

- Imperfect materials: Structural stress during transport (minor damage)

- One-time use: Burns out components (single activation)

- Power hungry: Requires tower's full power core (not portable)
LIMITATIONS: - Cannot teleport living beings safely (high mortality risk)

- Cannot teleport across dimensional barriers (Inner/Outer universe)

- Random destination within ~10,000 km radius (uncontrolled)

- Small chance of catastrophic failure (5% risk of explosion)
USAGE (STORY CLIMAX):: - Connected to Casil's tower power core (ley line tap)

- Combined with modified Pocket Dimension (cuts space around tower)

- Activates during confrontation with Casil + Royal Tower mages

- Result: Entire tower teleports randomly (lands in wilderness)

- Casil left behind (tower = John's prize)
