NAME: Character-Specific Magic (John)
ROLE: magic_system
OTHER NAMES: Void magic, dimensional magic, spatial manipulation
SPELL 1: MINI GATE: Circle Level: 1st (basic space spell)

Original Purpose: Training exercise for apprentice space mages (introduction to Gate spell)

Original Design:

- Opens two connected portals (entry + exit)

- Requires: Line of sight to exit point

- Entry gate must be near caster (arm's reach)

- Size: Adjustable (fist-sized to doorway—with practice)

- Duration: While maintained (requires focus)

- Mana cost: Moderate (less efficient than true Gate spell)

Limitations:

- Cannot penetrate strong barriers/formations (unless caster power >> barrier strength)

- Distraction = instant collapse

- Maximum range: ~30 meters (for skilled 3rd-circle mage)

- Energy inefficient (uses 30% more mana than true Gate for same effect)

- Both portals must be in same "space" (can't cross dimensional barriers)

John's Modifications (Years 2-4):

- Year 2: Combined with Minor Teleport theory

- Can place exit gate beyond line of sight (by "feeling" space)

- Maximum range: ~50 meters

- Requires: High mana sensitivity (basic exercises mastery)

- Year 3: Remote placement mastery

- Places gates by spatial awareness (not visual)

- Precision improves with practice

- Maximum range: ~100 meters

- Year 4: Multi-gate capability

- Can maintain 2-4 portal pairs simultaneously (extreme focus)

- Combat tested during tower attack

John's Statistics (by Story End):

- Cast time: 1-2 seconds (7th-circle mage speed at 5th-circle power)

- Size control: Thumbnail to man-sized (precise adjustment)

- Range: 100+ meters (line of sight), 50+ meters (blind placement)

- Multi-cast: 2-4 pairs (depending on required precision)

- Silent casting: Yes (no incantation needed—mastery level)

Tactical Applications (John's Innovation):

- Projectile Redirection: Throw knife through gate → Appears at target (point-blank assassination)

- Spell Disruption: Micro-gate intersects enemy magic circle → Structure collapses

- Mana Absorption: Gates outside tower funnel ambient mana to John (hidden cultivation)

- Reconnaissance: Peek through gates (visual scouting)

- Ambush Setup: Gate behind enemy (attack from unexpected angle)

- Defense: Redirect enemy projectiles back at them

- Risk: Enemy can attack through the gate, enemy can become alerted if 

Original vs Modified:

- Original: Training tool (moving objects short distances)

- John's version: Weapon system (disruption, assassination, tactical control)

- Key difference: Military mindset ("How to weaponize?")
SPELL 2: POCKET DIMENSION: Circle Level: 6th (high-level space spell—incomplete in Casil's study)

Original Purpose: Storage magic (create dimensional space for carrying items)

Original Design:

- Creates pocket dimension inside object (ring, pouch, box)

- Proportion: 1:100 (1m³ outside = 100m³ inside—massive storage)

- Cast on external objects only (embedded via formation)

- Permanent effect (once formed, stays until object destroyed)

- Common use: Noble storage rings, merchant caravans

John's Modification:

- Cast INSIDE his body (within mana pool shell)

- Proportion: 1:1 (NOT storage—structural support only)

- Function: Isolates mana from body, lower pressure on mana pool shell (needed until completed evolution)

- Must be maintained continuously (drop it = death from shell rupture)

Impossible feat (explained below)

Why This Is Impossible:

- Evolved bodies resist internal spells (body response to artificial mana structures)

- Dimensional barriers are rigid (body movement should tear spell apart)

- Continuous maintenance (requires attention 24/7—impossible for normal mages)

- Death on failure (one mistake = mana pool ruptures = instant death)

Why John Succeeded:

1. Un-evolved body (no mana resistance yet—body accepts foreign structure - body is evolving to adapt and integrate foreign structure)

2. Human constitution (humans have special mana adaptability—see worldbuilding, and bodies able to adapt to anything - under right conditions)

3. Space affinity (only space mages could attempt dimensional barrier internally)

4. Months of practice (trained spell maintenance to subconscious level)

5. Military discipline (pain tolerance, focus endurance, risk acceptance)

6. Desperation (only option for survival—willing to risk death)

Training Process:

- Week 1: Cast spell, maintain 30 seconds (nearly dies from loss of focus)

- Week 2-3: Maintain during sleep (dozen minutes at first)

- Week 4: Can move slowly while maintaining

- Week 6: Normal movement while maintaining

- Month 3: Subconscious maintenance (spell runs automatically)

- Year 1+: Perfect automation (can cast other spells while maintaining)

Function:

- Acts as artificial mana pool shell (prevents rupture)

- Enables safe mana absorption (no more poisoning)

- Allows controlled evolution (John guides adaptation process)

- Foundation for future modifications (can expand dimension later)

Limitations:

- Must be maintained forever (drop it = death)

- Blocks natural mana flow (John must manually move mana in/out)

- Attention cost (small, but constant—like breathing manually)

- If John is knocked unconscious (spell might drop—high risk)


SPELL 3: MINOR VEIL: Circle Level: 2nd (John's original creation)

Original Inspiration: Hiding formations (from Casil's library)

John's Design:

- Space-affinity concealment spell

- Cast over Pocket Dimension (hides its presence)

- Function: Masks mana pressure, unusual pool structure

- Can be toggled on/off (unlike Pocket Dimension—must always be active)

How It Works:

- Creates spatial "fold" around mana pool

- Bends mana perception around target (like light bending)

- Observer sees: Normal weak 1st-circle mage pool

- Reality: 5th-circle mage with dimensional barrier inside

Limitations:

- Imperfect: Deep scan by 7th+ circle mage can detect anomaly

- Mana cost: Small but constant (when active)

- Range: Only hides John's own mana signature (can't hide others)

- Specific focus required: If scanner knows what to look for, harder to hide

Training:

- Week 1-2: Learn hiding formations (study references)

- Week 3: Adapt to space affinity (modify structure)

- Week 4-6: Practice casting + maintaining with Pocket Dimension

- Month 3+: Master toggle (can activate/deactivate at will)

Tactical Use:

- Appears weak (enemies underestimate John)

- Passes inspections (Casil doesn't detect true power)

- Can drop veil for surprise (sudden power reveal in combat)


SPELL 4: MINOR TELEPORT: Circle Level: 2nd (basic space spell)

Original Purpose: Training exercise for Teleport spell

Original Design:

- Short-range self-teleportation (5-10 meters)

- Requires: Line of sight to destination

- Instant travel (no transit time)

- Mana cost: Moderate

John's Use:

- Primary: Combined with Mini Gate (enables remote gate placement)

- Secondary: Studied for Space Jump Box artifact (see below)

- Limited practical use: John prefers Mini Gate (more versatile), but can use Minor teleport to evade attack
