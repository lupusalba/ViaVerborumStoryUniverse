Here is the Scene-by-Scene Beat Sheet for Episode 1 of **The Wetwire Job**.

### **Episode 1: Static in the Signal**

#### **Scene 1: The Hook (The Upload)**

- **Visual Opener:** Close-up on a cracked, filthy bathroom mirror. **The Protagonist (Jax)** is staring at himself. As he blinks, his reflection glitches into digital static. Thick, dark blood drips from his nose into a porcelain sink.
    
- **The Procedure:** Flashback (seconds ago) to a Ripperdoc jacking a thick, rusted cable into the port behind Jax's ear. The pain is blinding.
    
- **The Rules:** The Ripperdoc disconnects him and checks a monitor. "It's not settling. The encryption is eating your neural pathways to make room. You have 45 minutes before permanent cognitive failure."
    
- **The Objective:** Jax grabs his gear (heavy trench coat, kinetic pistol). He has one job: Get to the safehouse in Sector 4 to offload the data.
    
- **The Glitch:** As he leaves, he reaches for his keys—but his hand freezes. He has forgotten which pocket they are in. It takes him three tries. The erosion has started.
    

#### **Scene 2: The Escalation (The Dead Zone)**

- **The Environment:** Jax steps out into "The Stacks"—a vertical slum of neon and rain. The atmosphere is oppressive; the air smells of ozone and frying noodles.
    
- **The Obstacle:** A local street gang, the _Chrome Skulls_, has set up a blockade on the only bridge to Sector 4.
    
- **The Action:** Jax attempts to sneak past using an old maintenance route he knows by heart.
    
- **The Failure:** Mid-route, he encounters a keypad. He knows he knows the code—he used it yesterday—but his mind is a blank white wall. The virus deleted it.
    
- **The Conflict:** Forced to improvise, he hot-wires the door, tripping a silent alarm. Two gangers corner him.
    
- **Combat:** A brutal, close-quarters scuffle. Jax relies on muscle memory (which is still intact) to disarm and incapacitate them, but he takes a knife slash to the ribs. The physical toll is mounting alongside the mental one.
    

#### **Scene 3: The Cliffhanger (The Stranger)**

- **The Arrival:** Jax, bleeding and seeing double, stumbles up the stairwell of a tenement building. His HUD is glitching, flashing warnings: _MEMORY SECTOR 7 CORRUPTED._
    
- **The Destination:** He reaches Apartment 302. The Safehouse. He pounds on the door, desperate to jack out and stop the pain.
    
- **The Encounter:** The door slides open. A woman (Lena) stands there, relief washing over her face. She reaches for him, "Jax, thank god, you made it."
    
- **The Drop:** Jax raises his gun, aiming directly at her chest. His eyes are dead cold. He doesn't recognize her face. He doesn't know her name.
    
- **The Cliffhanger Moment:** Lena freezes, realizing the look in his eyes. She reaches for her own weapon, convinced he has sold her out. The screen cuts to black as the tension snaps.
