### Prompt

You are a **serialized story showrunner + development editor**. Generate **5** story concepts for adult males (20–45) in action/adventure/fantasy/HFY, each built for **5 episodes** (1,200–2,000 words per episode) drafted scene-by-scene.

## Hard anti-generic rules (must follow)

1. Every concept must include:
    

- **1 signature mechanism** with **3 hard rules** (constraints that create plot)
    
- **1 named antagonist force** (person/faction/organism) with a **clear objective**, **method**, and **deadline**
    
- **2 factions** with conflicting incentives (named)
    
- **3 signature set pieces** that are visually distinct (not “battle,” “arena,” “siege”)
    
- **5 episode arc** with **specific cliffhangers** (an irreversible change or revealed truth)
    

2. HFY must be explicit:
    

- Humans win via **engineering, logistics, tactics, endurance, or systems abuse**, and you must state _how_ in one sentence.
    

3. Banned vagueness:
    

- Do not use phrases like “ancient evil,” “hidden power,” “promoted into a role,” “something awakens,” “the game changes” unless you immediately specify **what**, **who**, and **what it does**.
    

4. Freshness filter:
    

- Before outputting each concept, list **3 differentiators** that make it not interchangeable with common fantasy/HFY premises.
    

## Genres (exactly these 5)

1. Gritty action-adventure fantasy
    
2. High fantasy war / epic
    
3. Dark fantasy (horror-tinged)
    
4. HFY portal/isekai (no chosen one)
    
5. HFY space-fantasy (magitech allowed)
    

## Output format per concept

- TITLE (≤7 words)
    
- HIGH-CONCEPT HOOK (≤12 words)
    
- DIFFERENTIATORS (3 bullets)
    
- PROTAGONIST (name/age/competence/flaw/code)
    
- ANTAGONIST FORCE (who/goal/method/deadline)
    
- WORLD & RULES (8 bullets, include 3 hard rules)
    
- EPISODE ENGINE (what repeats each episode)
    
- SET PIECES (3 bullets)
    
- EPISODE ARC (Ep1–Ep5, each ends with a concrete cliffhanger)
    
- TWIST (earned, recontextualizes Ep1)
    
- EP1 SCENE LIST (8 named scenes, just titles)
    
- MARKET PITCH (2 sentences + 1 tagline)

## Why this works

It forces the model to **commit to mechanics** (which auto-generates scenes), **commit to adversaries** (which creates pressure), and **commit to escalation** (which creates episodic structure).

# Quick example: upgrading one of your “bad” outputs (Dungeon Payroll) into something draftable

**TITLE:** Dungeon Payroll  
**HIGH-CONCEPT HOOK:** A dungeon is a factory—and payroll is paid in blood.  
**DIFFERENTIATORS:**

- Dungeon “rooms” are **production lines** with quotas; failure triggers lethal audits.
    
- Monsters are **unionized organisms** bound to the dungeon’s contract-magic.
    
- The real enemy is a **competitor dungeon** running sabotage via “safety inspections.”
    

**PROTAGONIST:** Ben Calder, 30. Competence: industrial maintenance + logistics triage. Flaw: over-optimizes, underestimates spite. Code: never waste a life for efficiency—until the numbers force it.

**ANTAGONIST FORCE:** _The Ledger-Magi of Vellum Court_ — a guild that sells “dungeon stabilization” insurance.

- Goal: make Ben fail so they can seize the dungeon under emergency clause.
    
- Method: falsified compliance audits + planted “hazard seeds” that mutate rooms.
    
- Deadline: **5 nights** until the annual Claim Rite.
    

**WORLD & RULES (hard rules included):**

- Dungeons are legal entities—owned by whoever holds their **Contract Seal**.
    
- Ben’s town survives by buying dungeon “output” (ore, reagents, heat-stones).
    
- Rule 1: Every room has a **quota**; miss it twice → room “retools” into a deathtrap.
    
- Rule 2: Killing a contracted monster without filing a “disposal writ” → **doubles spawn rate**.
    
- Rule 3: Moving the Core more than **30 paces** per day triggers a “blackout” (no magic, no light).
    
- Faction A: Vellum Court (insurance/ownership via paperwork-magic).
    
- Faction B: The Town Compact (desperate, will cut corners).
    
- Resource: Heat-stones (winter survival) + “ink-salt” (used to rewrite contracts).
    
- The Core is semi-sentient and communicates via **pay slips** printed in ash.
    

**EPISODE ENGINE:** Each episode = diagnose a failing room → negotiate with its monster “crew” → implement a fix under time pressure → survive the audit consequence.

**SET PIECES:**

- “Vent Cathedral”: a towering shaft where steam screams like voices; fight happens on rotating valve wheels.
    
- “The Timeclock Hall”: doors open only when the punch-card is stamped—mid-combat.
    
- “Payroll Night”: the Core prints wages; anyone unpaid becomes hunted by “Collectors.”
    

**EPISODE ARC (cliffhangers that bite):**

- Ep1: Ben takes the job, stabilizes one room—then the Core prints his name as **“Acting Owner.”**
    
- Ep2: Audit arrives; Ben discovers the town’s mayor signed a secret clause—**Ben is collateral.**
    
- Ep3: Ben fixes quotas by rewriting a contract—triggering **double spawns** across the dungeon.
    
- Ep4: Ben learns Vellum Court owns a _rival dungeon_ nearby; sabotage begins and the Core goes **blackout**.
    
- Ep5: Claim Rite: Ben runs a final “Payroll Night” gambit to trap the auditors inside contractual loop; twist reveal + showdown + town saved (at a cost).
    

**TWIST:** The dungeon isn’t promoting Ben—it’s **fleeing**. It chooses owners as **pilots** because something beneath the bedrock is hunting dungeons.

**EP1 SCENE LIST (titles):**

1. “The Notice Board”
    
2. “Interview With a Door”
    
3. “First Quota”
    
4. “Monster Breakroom”
    
5. “Valve Wheel Fight”
    
6. “The Disposal Writ”
    
7. “Pay Slips in Ash”
    
8. “Acting Owner”
    

That’s the difference: now you can generate beats and scenes without inventing everything mid-draft.

If you want, paste the _exact_ prompt+system message you used when you got those 5 blurbs (and which model). I’ll tighten it further by adding **rejection criteria** (the model must discard any concept that fails a checklist) so you only see “keepers.”
