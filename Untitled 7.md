# v0.2 ADDITIONS (drop-in sections)
Goal: patch the biggest plot-hole zones (boundary/contact logic + missing mega-empire cards)

## 3.2 Empire of Beasts (FACTION CARD — FILLED)

### CANON (existing)
- “Magic beasts — dragons and similar; extremely high individual power; born with high power level.” :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

### CANON (new, minimal but plot-useful)
- The “Empire” is not a bureaucracy; it’s a **dominion web** of apex territories enforced by overwhelmingly powerful individuals.

### GOAL (what they want)
- Secure and expand **prime mana ecologies** (breeding grounds, hunting spheres, hoards of rare resources).
- Prevent industrial-scale extraction that collapses ecosystems (because it collapses their power base).

### METHOD (how they project power)
- **Apex deterrence:** a few top entities enforce borders.
- **Tribute ecology:** vassal species (intelligent and non-intelligent) feed resources upward.
- **Migration war:** they relocate entire populations through fear and predation rather than administration.

### CONSTRAINT (what stops them)
- **Low density / slow reproduction:** they can’t flood space with numbers.
- **Territory dependence:** peak power requires living in mana-rich nodes (they weaken if forced into “thin mana” regions for long).
- **Coordination ceiling:** apex egos cause internal conflict; alliances are temporary.

### WEAKNESS (how they can lose)
- Logistics + traps:
  - engineered kill-zones
  - null materials (Deadstone)
  - swarm tactics that deny “single target dominance”

### STANCE ON HUMANS (set for later stories)
- **Default:** “irrelevant” (mana-blind, outer-dead sector).
- **If contact occurs:** split response:
  - Some see humans as prey.
  - Some see humans as *dangerous tool-makers* who can mass-produce counters.

### SIGNATURE ASSETS (slots)
- [OPEN SLOT] 1) “Brood-World” / hatchery moon (prime mana node)
- [OPEN SLOT] 2) “Elder Apex” deterrent entity (name + territory)
- [OPEN SLOT] 3) Beast-route through Boundary belts (they can brute-force corridors)

### INTERNAL FACTIONS (simple, high-utility)
- **Broodlords:** prioritize breeding grounds; avoid needless wars.
- **Hoard-Kings:** prioritize rare materials; provoke conflict.
- **Wild Communion:** anti-“empire” purists; want pure predation order.

## 3.3 Empire of Shadows (FACTION CARD — FILLED)

### CANON (existing)
- “Mysterious; small numbers; power equal to other empires.” :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

### CANON (new, minimal but plot-useful)
- Shadows are a **scarce species/faction** whose power is **asymmetric**: they win via infiltration, denial, and precision—never mass armies.

### GOAL (what they want)
- Preserve a long-term balance where no single empire becomes an unchallengeable hegemon.
- Accumulate “imprints” (identity/memory/true-name residues) required for their survival/reproduction. (Details can stay AUTHOR SECRET.)

### METHOD (how they project power)
- **Infiltration:** mimic roles, sabotage governance, steer wars.
- **Denial warfare:** create localized “blind zones” (sensor denial, scrying denial, comms decay).
- **Precision strikes:** eliminate a single keystone person/artifact to collapse an enemy plan.

### CONSTRAINT (what stops them)
- **Small numbers** (scarcity is real). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- **Anchor dependence:** they require prepared anchor-sites to operate at full power for long periods.
- **Exposure risk:** prolonged open combat “burns” them (they lose what makes them dominant).

### WEAKNESS (how they can lose)
- Identity anchors and detection:
  - true-name/identity binding
  - wide-area “clarity” fields (light/ordering mana)
  - disciplined bureaucracies (harder to infiltrate)

### STANCE ON HUMANS (clean, useful split)
- **Public stance (Inner):** Outer is dead; humans don’t exist. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
- **AUTHOR SECRET option:** Shadows are the *first* Inner faction to suspect the Outer isn’t dead (gives you espionage-first-contact plots).

### SIGNATURE ASSETS (slots)
- [OPEN SLOT] 1) “Umbra Court” / central conclave (if they even have one)
- [OPEN SLOT] 2) “Null-lace” tech/magic (denial zones)
- [OPEN SLOT] 3) “Shadow Corridor” through Boundary belts (rare, mapped, guarded)

### INTERNAL FACTIONS (simple, high-utility)
- **Wardens:** balance keepers; prevent hegemonies.
- **Harvesters:** prioritize imprint collection; provoke chaos.
- **Exiles:** rogue cells; sell secrets to nobles/beasts.

## 8.1 First Contact Triggers (FILLED, minimal)
Pick any one to start your series; they all fit current canon.

- **Human survey crosses into faint mana** → catastrophic exposure unless contained (>98% die uncontrolled). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- **Magic House expedition** seeks Boundary null-material and stumbles into human space.
- **Shadow infiltration** uses humans as a new lever against Magic Empire governance.
- **Beast migration** forces a “corridor event” and sweeps both sides into collision.
- **Human resource program** pushes toward Inner abundance because Outer scarcity is limiting. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
