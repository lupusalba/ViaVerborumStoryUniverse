Here are 5 high-octane story pitches blending Cyberpunk and Noir, tailored for the adult male demographic.

### 1. The Wetwire Job

- **Genre:** Cyberpunk Noir
    
- **The Logline:** A data smuggler must cross a hostile, gang-controlled sector to deliver a decryption key stored in his own brain, but the data is a virus that is deleting his memories minute by minute.
    
- **The "TikTok" Visual Hook:** A POV shot in a dirty bathroom mirror where the protagonist’s reflection glitches into digital static while blood drips from his nose.
    
- **The Episode 1 "Paywall" Cliffhanger:** The protagonist reaches the safehouse, but when the door opens, he stares blankly at his partner—the virus has just deleted the memory of who she is, and she thinks he's turned traitor.
    
- **The Twist (Ep 3):** The data he is carrying isn't a weapon or stolen credits—it is a backup of his own personality from before he became a criminal, commissioned by his estranged wife to "overwrite" the man he has become.
    

### 2. Room 404

- **Genre:** Tech-Noir Thriller
    
- **The Logline:** A corrupt vice cop wakes up handcuffed to a radiator in a burning penthouse alongside the Mayor’s dead mistress and has 20 minutes to escape before the fire department—and the media—arrive.
    
- **The "TikTok" Visual Hook:** A hyper-realistic close-up of a handcuffed wrist straining against metal, illuminated by the orange glow of a fire rapidly consuming a luxury apartment.
    
- **The Episode 1 "Paywall" Cliffhanger:** He dislocates his thumb to slip the cuff, but as he stands over the "dead" body, she gasps awake and grabs his ankle—she's alive, she's the one who drugged him, and she just swallowed the key to the exit.
    
- **The Twist (Ep 3):** The apartment isn't real; he is in a high-fidelity VR interrogation simulation run by Internal Affairs, and he has to die in the simulation to wake up in the real world.
    

### 3. Redline Tokyo

- **Genre:** Cyberpunk Action
    
- **The Logline:** A retired getaway driver with a cybernetic heart is forced to transport a volatile package across Neo-Tokyo; if his heart rate drops below 120 BPM, the explosive in his chest detonates.
    
- **The "TikTok" Visual Hook:** A split-screen showing a tachometer redlining at 200MPH on the left, and a biometric monitor spiking at 150 BPM on the right, set against a blur of neon lights.
    
- **The Episode 1 "Paywall" Cliffhanger:** He outruns the Yakuza pursuit and hits the highway, but his car’s AI is hacked and the brakes are locked—he is hurtling toward a police blockade at max speed with no way to stop.
    
- **The Twist (Ep 3):** The package in the trunk is a child—a clone of the Emperor—and the client hiring him to keep his heart rate up is actually the clone communicating telepathically to feed off his adrenaline.
    

### 4. The Silhouette Man

- **Genre:** Retro-Futuristic Noir
    
- **The Logline:** In a city where privacy is illegal and everyone wears body-cams, a detective who can turn "invisible" to cameras investigates a murder that strictly shouldn't be possible.
    
- **The "TikTok" Visual Hook:** A black-and-white security feed of a crowded subway station where one man is rendered as a terrifying, solid black void that distorts the space around him.
    
- **The Episode 1 "Paywall" Cliffhanger:** The detective corners the killer in an alley, but when the killer steps into the light, the detective sees his own face—it's his younger, un-augmented self holding the gun.
    
- **The Twist (Ep 3):** The detective is actually an AI algorithm designed to solve cold cases, and the "killer" is the real human he was modeled after, trying to delete the program.
    

### 5. Vertical Hell

- **Genre:** Cyberpunk Survival
    
- **The Logline:** A repo-man is trapped on the bottom floor of a kilometer-high corporate tower when the building goes into "Purge Mode," filling with neurotoxin from the ground up.
    
- **The "TikTok" Visual Hook:** A wide shot looking up the center of a hollow mega-tower, seeing 100 floors of blast doors slamming shut one by one, accompanied by a deafening siren.
    
- **The Episode 1 "Paywall" Cliffhanger:** He fights his way to the only functional elevator, but as the doors close, a desperate woman throws a bag inside—it contains the severed head of the CEO, which is needed to override the security at the top.
    
- **The Twist (Ep 3):** The "Purge" isn't a malfunction; it's a scheduled cleaning of the lower-class residents, and the repo-man realizes his own ID badge lists him as "Disposable Waste."
