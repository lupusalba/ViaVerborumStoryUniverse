## ACT I – THE ARRIVAL (5,000–6,000 words)

---

### Scene 1 – **“The Gate”** (~800–1,000 words)

**POV:** MC (3rd person limited)  
**Purpose:** Introduce MC, hint that the city is personally significant, without fully revealing revenge.

**Content:**

- MC approaches the capital at sunset, traveling light, dressed like a seasoned wanderer.
    
- Guards note:
    
    - Late 30s, controlled movements, no visible weapon.
        
    - Papers/pass token in order (establish he’s not sneaking in).
        
- MC notices small details:
    
    - New outer wall where there used to be only fields.
        
    - A district renamed; a noble banner from his childhood replaced by a new crest.
        
    - Internal reaction is minimal but edged: the reader feels this place matters to him.
        
- Gate inspection:
    
    - Guard feels a strange “pressure,” then dismisses it; MC is polite, unthreatening.
        
- Inside the city:
    
    - Streets wider, new fountains, richer markets.
        
    - MC walks like someone who once lived here, but never states it.
        
- Ends:
    
    - He takes a quiet room at an inn.
        
    - Guard captain or messenger later bursts in: rumors that “one of the Eight Stars” is in the city begin to spread.
        

---

### Scene 2 – **“The Court Stirs”** (~1,000–1,200 words)

**POV:** Court Scribe Aldric  
**Purpose:** Show the empire’s competence, the Emperor’s mind, and that the Guardian Knight and key officers are deliberately summoned (with a note that _not all_ are).

**Content:**

- Morning at court: Aldric copying decrees, summarizing petitions.
    
- Report arrives: “A Star has entered the capital.” The name used is his wandering epithet.
    
- Court speculation:
    
    - Briefly sketch the Eight Stars and their reputations.
        
    - MC’s epithet: the Wandering Star, rumored to mediate wars and slay monsters.
        
- Emperor’s response:
    
    - Calm, strategic, not panicked.
        
    - Orders:
        
        - Full formal audience, maximum ceremony.
            
        - Guardian Knight to attend.
            
        - Summon **as many top generals, ministers, and high mages as possible**.
            
        - Note: some key figures are away (border command, rival minister, distant governor) – Aldric notes this subtly in his records.
            
- Aldric’s observation:
    
    - Understands this is a calculated risk: gathering the core of the empire’s power in one room to assess a Star.
        
- Ends:
    
    - The formal invitation is drafted and sealed.
        
    - Aldric watches the courier ride out, thinking: “Today’s record will matter.”
        

---

### Scene 3 – **“The Heralds Proclaim”** (~1,200–1,500 words)

**POV:** Primarily Scribe Aldric, with controlled paragraphs from MC  
**Purpose:** Ceremony, MC’s status, build tension for the name reveal.

- MC arrives at the palace.
    
    - Hands over his sword without fuss at the gate – tradition and confidence.
        
- Aldric describes the throne room:
    
    - Emperor on high seat.
        
    - Guardian Knight at his side.
        
    - Generals, ministers, high mages present; a few notable absences mentioned (those away on duty).
        
- MC’s entrance:
    
    - Perfect etiquette, controlled presence.
        
    - He’s not ostentatious; only those sensitive to aura sense something off.
        
- Heralds proclaim:
    
    - Wandering titles and epithets (monster-slayer, battle-mediator, tournament champion).
        
    - Compact list of 3–5 sharp achievements rather than a huge dump.
        
- Aldric’s view:
    
    - Impressed but professional; notes the foreign campaigns and political weight of such a man.
        
- MC’s brief internal notes:
    
    - Detached at some titles, mild dislike of one nickname, neutral on others.
        
- Emperor formally welcomes him.
    
- Ends:
    
    - MC bows correctly, then raises his head, looking straight at the Emperor.
        
    - The room settles into expectant silence.

### Scene 4 – **“The Name That Was”** (~1,200–1,500 words)

**POV:** MC  
**Purpose:** Reveal his erased identity; clarify stakes; lay moral ground.

**Content:**

- MC speaks calmly:
    
    - “Your heralds have not spoken all of my names.”
        
- He gives his **true first and family name**.
    
- Reaction:
    
    - Immediate confusion.
        
    - Older ministers go pale as they recognize the name of a long-erased minor house.
        
- Emperor requests clarification.
    
- MC explains:
    
    - Minor countryside count, executed decades ago.
        
    - Estate and name erased by Imperial Knight Order.
        
- Old justiciar/minister reads the official record:
    
    - Corrupt, drunk, extortion, potential treason.
        
    - Recommendation and execution of full-line erasure, including household.
        
- MC confirms:
    
    - “Most of this is true. My father was a bad lord, and I don’t defend him.”
        
    - Then he adds specific innocents: younger siblings, a bookish sister, a sickly brother, old steward, villagers who did nothing.
        
- Emperor’s response:
    
    - Doesn’t remember the specific house, but recognizes the policy as his.
        
    - He explains his doctrine:
        
        - Noble rot threatens the realm.
            
        - Half-measures invite rebellion, civil war.
            
        - Sometimes entire houses must be torn out.
            
    - He expresses regret for innocent deaths but states clearly:
        
        - “If presented with the same facts again, I would choose the same. For the empire.”
            
- MC nods:
    
    - “I expected as much. Your logic is sound—for a ruler.”
        
    - “But I am not a ruler. I am the last son of that house. And I have come to settle accounts.”
        
- The court tenses.
    
- Ends:
    
    - MC slowly lifts his hand.

**Content:**

- MC’s raised hand:
    
    - Air tightens, temperature dips, a ripple passes through the hall.
        
- Aura visibly coalesces:
    
    - Distortion, then a clear blade of condensed energy forms.
        
- Aldric’s reaction:
    
    - Realizes only a few of the Eight Stars are rumored to manifest pure aura weapons.
        
    - Sees even hardened warriors flinch.

**Purpose:** Personal duel; show MC’s skill and Guardian’s worth; first major shock.

**Content:**

- Detailed, focused fight between Guardian Knight and MC.
    
    - Guardian’s technique: decades of service, precise, powerful.
        
    - MC’s technique: minimal movement, superior timing, small shifts that invalidate entire attacks.
        
- Aldric’s perspective:
    
    - Awe at the Guardian’s skill (this is the empire’s shield).
        
    - Horror as he realizes the Guardian is losing anyway.
        
- The Guardian recognizes mid-fight he cannot win but refuses to retreat.

- Aldric notes: the hall is stunned; the empire’s living legend is dead in moments.
    
- Ends:
    
    - MC turns toward the remaining elites.
        

---

### Scene 7 – **“The Storm of Steel”** (~1,500–2,000 words)

**POV:** Scribe Aldric  
**Purpose:** Show mass slaughter as controlled montage; avoid fight repetition.

**Content:**

- Generals and mages move in coordinated assault; professional, not chaotic.
    
- Aldric records:
    
    - Short, sharp snapshots rather than blow-by-blow:
        
        - A general’s command cut short mid-shout.
            
        - A shield wall broken by a single aura sweep.
            
        - Mages’ barriers shattered like glass.
            
    - Furniture shattered, banners cut down, blood marking the pristine floor.
        
- MC never taunts; he’s silent, efficient.
    
- Emperor remains seated, watching.
    
- Aldric vacillates between doing his duty as scribe and sheer terror.
    
- Emphasis: **numbers don’t matter**; only ability does.
    
- Ends:
    
    - The last organized group falls.
        
    - Only scattered, desperate attacks remain.

**Content:**

- Final desperate group charges; MC ends them with one sweeping aura technique or a controlled explosion of force.
    
- Silence drops over the hall.
    
- MC’s internal reaction:
    
    - Clinical assessment: they were competent, but outmatched.
        
    - No thrill, no joy—just completion of a step.
        
- He takes in the scene:
    
    - Dead Guardian, dead generals, fallen court figures.
        
    - Notices a few empty seats (the absent officials mentioned earlier).
        
- He sheaths the aura blade (dismisses it).
    
- He notes Aldric hiding, but ignores him—scribes aren’t his target.
    
- He walks toward the throne, each step echoing.
    
- Ends:
    
    - MC stands before the Emperor.
        

---

    - MC: “Not yet. You are the last debt.”
        
- Emperor questions:
    
    - “You condemn my decision to erase your house. Yet you have slaughtered my guardians, generals, and ministers in a single afternoon. How is your justice less cruel?”
        
- MC’s answer:
    
    - He acknowledges what he’s done:
        
        - “I killed those who chose to take up the sword and wield power. I left their children and peasants untouched.”
            
        - “I cut the branches that grew willingly around your throne. You burned the roots, the soil, and everything living there.”
            
    - He doesn’t claim innocence. He claims **choice and boundaries**.
        
- Emperor recognizes:
    
    - MC has drawn his own moral line—different from imperial policy, but not without thought.
        
- Emperor returns to the future:
    
    - With him and many leaders dead, the empire will be seen as weak.
        
    - Other powers will invade; common people will suffer.
        
- He asks:
    
    - “Will you bear that burden? Will you keep the empire alive after you kill it?”
        
- MC:
    
    - “I will choose your successor. I will stand behind them. And I will give the world a reason to hesitate.”
        
- Final exchange:
    
    - Emperor: “Your family died by my justice.”
        
    - MC: “And you die by mine.”
        
- Emperor sits straighter, accepts.
    
- One clean stroke of aura; swift death.
    
- Emperor’s last thought: acknowledgement that he’s facing the consequence of his doctrine.
    
- Ends:
    
    - MC turns toward the doors.

- MC arrives, blood still on his clothes, aura tightly leashed.
    
- They are led into a side hall or smaller chamber where their father’s body is visible in the distance or in memory.
    
- Interviews:
    
    - Eldest: arrogant, speaks of revenge for father, demands command → MC politely dismisses him.
        
    - Another: panicked, begs for mercy → dismissed.
        
    - Another: tries to attack MC → disarmed gently but totally, dismissed.
        
    - The future New Emperor:
        
        - Terrified, but thinking.
            
        - Answers questions about provinces, taxes, army logistics, and famine relief.
            
        - Admits ignorance where appropriate but offers pragmatic solutions.
            
- MC’s evaluation:
    
    - He doesn’t care who wants the throne; he cares who can hold it.
        
    - “You will be emperor.”
        
- New Emperor protests:
    
    - “I didn’t ask for this.”

    - Coronation today.
        
    - He will oversee the first steps.

- The throne room:
    
    - Bodies removed, but blood stains remain.
        
    - Surviving courtiers, a few generals and mages who were absent earlier return to a changed world.
        
- Coronation:
    
    - Hasty, but still formal enough to be recognized by law.
        
    - Aldric reads the proclamation; MC dictated it.
        
    - New Emperor swears oaths:

        - To stabilize the empire.

    - MC orders plain swords brought, along with simple wooden boxes.
        
    - Remaining officials watch, confused.
        
- MC explains the plan:

        - Empire does not seek war.
            
        - Internal rot will be handled internally.
            
        - Attacks will be met.

    - Picks up shards, one by one.
        
    - Imprints each shard with a portion of his aura and killing intent.

        - Feels the pressure radiating even before the shard is boxed.
            
- Boxes:
    
    - 10–15 boxes prepared, each with a single shard.
        
    - Sealed without magic; just wood and hinges.
        
- MC instructs:
    
    - Diplomatic couriers to be sent to each major power.
        
    - Letters to be respectful but firm about intentions.
        
- New Emperor:
    
    - Realizes his reign begins under the shadow of a living deterrent.
        
    - Understands he must use this power carefully, not hide behind it.

    - King cancels immediate invasion plans.
        
    - Orders a reply letter recognizing the new emperor, expressing “interest in continued peace.”

    - They shift strategy from exploit → cautious diplomacy.
        
- Distant Theocracy:

    - They shelve crusade plans against the “weak” empire.
        
- Territory of another Star:
    
    - Another of the Eight Stars receives a box.

        - Withstand the aura, but barely; sweat, shaking, respect.
            
    - Realize:
        
        - “I could not imprint so many shards like this.”

    - Flags at half-mast, new emperor’s banner being raised.
        
    - A city that will have to live with what happened.
        
- Thoughts:
    
    - “My family is gone; nothing will change that.”
        
    - “But their deaths are answered.”
        
    - “The empire will stand, for now.”
        
- He turns toward the road:
    
    - There are other rumors: ruins, monsters, border wars, and problems that aren’t his old ghosts.
        
- Small, genuine smile:
    
    - Not blissful—just lighter.
        
- Final line/theme:
    
    - The Wandering Star has settled his past; from now on, he moves by choice, not by old wounds.
