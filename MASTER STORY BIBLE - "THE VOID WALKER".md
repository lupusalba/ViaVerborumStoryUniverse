## II. THE COSMOLOGY & POLITICS

### 1. The Galactic Context

- **The Divide:** The universe is split into two zones.
    
    - **The Dead Zones:** Home of the **Human Alliance**. Humans lived on "Death Worlds" (no mana). They colonized other Death Worlds. They are physically dense and adaptable but have zero mana history.
        
        - _Status:_ Humans are newcomers. They just started making waves in the galaxy and negotiating entry into the Galactic Alliance. They know mana exists but have no access to it.
            
    - **The Mana-Rich Zones:** Home of the **Magic Galactic Empire**. Ancient forces that rely on mana.
        
- **The Attack (Backstory):**
    
    - John’s ship was attacked by a **Mysterious Enemy** of the Human Alliance (not pirates).
        
    - To shift blame, the Enemy captured the humans and sold them to **Pirates**.
        
    - The Pirates, being smart, sold the humans to the **Black Market** on the far border of the neighboring galaxy (**Carina Anadeia**) to separate them and hide the evidence.
        
- **Carina Anadeia:** A border galaxy. Humans are effectively a myth here; practically zero presence.
    

### 2. The Planet (Setting)

- **The Black Market Planet:** A small, mana-active world used for illegal trades.
    
- **Casil’s Home Planet:**
    
    - **Environment:** Beautiful, lush, mana-dense. Mana is omnipresent and moves naturally.
        
    - **Technology:** Modern technology exists in the universe but is **rarely used** here because mana interference disrupts it. They rely on teleportation gates, formations, and "Flying Ships."
        
    - **Politics:** The planet belongs to the **Magic Galactic Empire**. It is governed by a single ruler (Imperial).
        
    - **Society:**
        
        - **Noble Races:** Elves and Dark Elves (Innate gift for magic).
            
        - **Knights:** Less gifted in control/sensitivity. They transform mana into **Aura** (circulating it in the body) rather than casting spells. and physcaly augment themself.
            
        - **Technicians:** Artifact Crafters.

## III. THE MAGIC SYSTEM (DETAILED)

### 1. Mana & Evolution

- **Nature:** Mana is a natural reagent for evolution and mutation.
    
- **Evolution Mechanics:** Exposure forces mutation. For a species to evolve, they must survive the mutation over generations.
    
- **The Human Anomaly:**
    
    - Humans are "Empty Vessels" (Compatible).
        
    - **Weak Shell:** The human body/soul container is brittle. Humans don't suffer immediately from exposure, but long-term accumulation causes the shell to break (Death).
        
    - **John's Evolution:** He **brute-forces** evolution. He has the resources of an Archmage (Casil) and human creativity. He evolves from Human v0.2 (Fragile) to v0.9 (Apex) to v1.0 (Evolved).
        
- **Absorption Efficiency:**
    
    - **Rule:** Mages absorb mana close to their affinity efficiently. Other types are inefficient.
        
    - **John:** Has **Universal High Efficiency**. He can absorb Fire, Water, Void, etc., instantly.
        
    - **Casting Restriction:** John **cannot cast** spells outside his affinity. He absorbs Fire mana, but cannot shape it into a Fireball. He can **only** cast Void/Space magic.
        

### 2. The Circle System (Mage Progression)

- **Concept:** Mages build magic circles _inside_ their mana pool to strengthen the shell, compress mana, and lower casting times. This magic circles are generic and universal. 6th and higher circles are restricted knowlage.
    
- **Tiers:** 1st to 9th Circle.
    
- **Lifespan Bonuses:**
    
    - **3rd Circle:** +20% Lifespan.
        
    - **6th Circle:** +50% Lifespan.
        
    - **9th Circle:** >50% Lifespan.
        
- **Difficulty:**
    
    - It is exponentially harder to cross thresholds: **3rd $\to$ 4th**, **6th $\to$ 7th**, **7th $\to$ 8th**.
        
    - **Inner Circles (1-3):** General, universal knowledge. Restricted/Controlled by the Royal Magic Tower.
        
    - **John’s Exception:** Human body is more compatible with mana then other species, it is blank sheet - humans did not yet evolve in final form as spicies, so they can guide evolution a little and increase affinity with magic. Downside is that if human does not evolve, he will die. All humans have experience with geometry and mathematics, and other complex disciplines that help them, since magic is different science for them.
        

### 3. Void Magic Specifics

- **Rarity:** Extremely rare. Space mages are protected assets, usually pampered "Luxury Couriers" for VIPs. They are rarely warriors.
    
- **John’s Spells:**
    
    - **Micro-Gate:** Usually a warm-up exercise. John weaponizes it.
        
    - **Basic Teleport:** Short range.
        
    - **Pocket Dimension:**
        
        - _The Text:_ Casil’s library has high-level theories, but they are considered "Impractical."
            
        - _John’s Innovation:_ He build pocket dimension of exact same size as his mana pool (pocket dimension is big space inside much smaller spaces, example: small bag with space inside of 10 cubic metars). John's pocket dimension is 1:1, because he can not cast complete spell. He postponed his death. He needs to increase his mana control, circle level and improve pocket dimension spell (since the one he got is incomplete)

## V. DETAILED EPISODE BEATS

### **Episode 1: The Crash & The Purchase**

- **The Backstory:** John’s ship is attacked by the **Mysterious Enemy**. Humans are captured, sold to Pirates, then sold to the Black Market in **Carina Anadeia**.
    
- **The Awakening:** John wakes on the Black Market planet. He feels the **Mana Pressure** (not immediate death, but a heavy, wrong feeling).
    
- **The Sale:** Casil scans the slaves. He notices John: A Human (Rare). He buys him on impulse.
    
- **The Departure:** Casil casts the **Language Spell** immediately. It overloads John’s unadapted brain. John blacks out for the duration of the trip.
    

### **Episode 2: The Dispersion & The Cure**

- **Recovery:** John wakes in the Tower (small stone room, basic bed/window). Migraine from the spell. He realizes he can understand the language now.
    
- **The Experiments:** Casil tests John’s absorption. It is painful. John feels his shell straining.
    
- **The Innovation:**
    
    - John realizes he needs to **expel** the mana to survive.
        
    - He refines **Mana Dispersion**. He practices it at night while exercising.
        
    - **The Healing:** He notices the mana flow accelerates evolution. **His nerve-damaged arms heal completely in a few days.**
        
- **Casil’s Misunderstanding:** Casil sees the venting and thinks John is "leaking" (broken vessel). He loses interest and leaves John as servant. John spends his free time in the library.
    

### **Episode 3: The Sniper & The Battery (Time Skip: ~2 Years)**

- **Status:** John is physically evolved (0.5). He has memorized the library.
    
- **The Limitation:** He learns _all_ theories but can _cast_ only Void.
    
- **The Fun Scene:** Out of boredom, John sits on the balcony. He opens linked **Micro-Gates** around the tower. He shoots pebbles through them to hit birds. He realizes the tactical potential (Ballistics).
    
- **The Crisis:** Absorption is too efficient. His shell is at risk of breaking.
    
- **The Solution:**
    
    - John finds the theoretical "Pocket Dimension" texts.
        
    - He builds an **Imperfect Internal Pocket Dimension** to act as walls of his mana pool, space ratio 1:1
        
    - It is not perfect, but it stabilizes him.
        
- **Mana Control:** He practices shaping waste mana into complex geometry outside his body (circles, lines). This inadvertently improves his mana control to extremely high level. He reach 3rd circle - he learned magic all magic circles from 1 to 5 in library. 6th and 7th circle is probably in Casil's personal library.
    

### **Episode 4: The Standoff**

- **The Context:** Casil leaves. A Rival Archmage attacks.
    
- **The Defense:**
    
    - John does not leave the tower. He locks it down.
        
    - **Tactics:** He uses Micro-Gates to **disrupt the mana flow** of the Rival’s spells (making them fizzle) and snipes him.
        
- **The Stalemate:** The Rival is stuck. John keeps him at bay.
    
- **The Return:** Casil returns, drives off the Rival. The Rival flees.
    
- **The Confrontation:**
    
    - Casil tries to enter. **Access Denied.** John has overridden the core.
        
    - **The Shock:** Casil realizes John is much more competent then expected. He is surprised and mildly disturbed.
        
- **The Oath:** John forces Casil into a **Student-Teacher Oath**. Casil agrees, but internally decides: _This human is dangerous. I must get rid of him._
    

### **Episode 5: The Betrayal (Time Skip: ~3 Years)**

- **Growth:** John reaches the **5th Circle**. He faces no bottlenecks.
    
- **Casil’s Fear:** Casil (stuck at 7th) realizes John is evolving too fast. He decides to act.
    
- **The Deal:** Casil negotiates with the Royal Magic Tower. He will trade John (as a "Living Strategic Gate") for the treasures needed to brute-force the 8th Circle.
    
- **The Artifact (Prototype):**
    
    - John finds the letters. He uses the lab to build a way home.
        
    - **Visual:** A **1x1 foot transparent crystal box** with a levitating sphere inside. Beautiful runes ruined by **4 ugly metal chains** welded to the corners (Human engineering).
        
    - **Function:** Blind Long-Range Teleportation. (It might reach a planet, it might not. Random destination).
