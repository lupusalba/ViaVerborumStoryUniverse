# FIXES FOR THE PROBLEMS IN THE STORY
fixes:

# 1) Universe compliance check
###  evolution timeline problem:
- John did not evolve. i did not specify it, but reason why he used pocket dimension is to bypass evolution requirement. 
- John evolved to 0.7 at the end of first story (with every step of evolution, he suffered less and less from mana poisoning, at 0.7 of evolution, he is no longer having obvious and big problems).
	- his life is no longer in danger
 - John is guiding his evolution in optimal direction for himself (by doing physical exercises and magic training) and progressing at controlled peace.
 - Biggest exposure to mana is inside body (mana pool), and that is quarantined by Pocket Dimension
 - from arrival to the tower, John spent more then 5 years (6 or 7) in the tower, till the end of story (time-skip is 5 years, and first 1 or 2 are introduction to routine and progress).

### Casil’s library contains restricted material problem:
- Casil is still part of the Royal magic tower technicality, and he is descendant of ancient noble family
- Casil is respected mage scholar who is still working with the tower. most of his research is submitted to the tower, and tower partly funds him
- Restrictions for knowledge are made for middle class and lower class, all great nobles have blueprints for 7th circle and 8th.
	- If mage is talented and loyal, he will get access to restricted blueprints
### The tower attack motivation is currently thin - problem:
- i need ideas for this one

### “Casil forgot about John” (Option B) is not believable as written problem:
we will go with option A, but take good parts of option B




# 2) The cleanest plot direction
- we will flow you suggestion

# 3) Fix the “tower attack” so it’s inevitable, plausible, and sharper
- **I DO NOT LIKE ANY OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS FOR THIS**
- **We will change identity of the attacker** - attacker will be part of terrorist/rebel group, and he wont be alone - two 7th circle mages will start attack on tower with group of 6th and 5th mages with a goal of stealing Casil's tower and all resources and killing Casil (famous and respected mage scholar of the Royal magic tower and descendant of ancient mage family)
- The reason Casil left in the hurry is because smaller part of group (1 7th circle mage and group of 6th and 5th circle mage attacked his family). His son (current patriarch of that branch family) sent him SOS and call for help
- John will kill (snipe, ambush) a few 5th circle mages and wound 6th circle mage
	- John will use throwing knives and similar "mortal" weapons (for mages this weapons are less detectable - since they are not used in the fights with mages)
	- John will disrupt combined attack of 7th circle mage and group of 6th circle mages (7th circle mage constructed the war spell and other mages added their mana, so they can pull more ambient mana to cast peak seventh circle war spell)
- Casil will be shocked by John's practical ability (since John will be at 3rd circle at that point)

### 4) Give John’s space magic hard rules (prevents Mary Sue vibes)
- John only have few spells:
	- **Mini Gate** - this spell was used as exercises by space mages, it was not used in a way that John uses it.
		- This spell, in its original form, requires of caster to have clear line of sight for second gate, and first gate must be close to the caster.
		- With practice, caster can change size of the gate, and increase the distance between two gates
		- This spell can not be cast inside barriers, formations or anything that separates one space from another (unless the difference between caster and other space is big).
			- If it is deployed in different space, then it increase mana consumption.
			- **Note**:** Casil's tower does not hinder deployment of spell from inside to outside. If John tried to cast mini gate from outside of the tower to inside, he would fail every time.
		- This spell uses little less mana then true Gate spell (it is energy inefficient)
		- When caster is distracted, it will crumble and fail
		- As John practice it more and more, added with it constant practice of basic mana exercise, John's sensitivity is increased.
			- When John learn Minor Teleport, he started to combine it with the Mini Gate (to make new spell) and after 3 years, when he reached 4th circle, he succeeded in deploying Mini gate outside of his view  - but in the spot he felt. with more practice, he could position it more and more precisely.
		- The Mini Gate at the beginning and at the end, are not the same spell - John completely modified it.
		- When John was fighting against attackers, he had clear line of sight through one way windows (he could see outside, they could not see him)
	- **Pocket Dimension** - this spell was incomplete (it is 6th circle spell), John modified it to be more a container for mana, with proportion of size outside and inside 1:1 (true spell has proportion of 1:100, example: box 1x1x1m outside, but space inside is 100x100x100m)
		- This spell is used as storage spell, to make moving things easier
		- this spell is commonly embedded on rings, bracelets and pouches (things easy to carry) by formation masters and artifact crafters.
		- **no one used this spell inside of their body - one mistake and they are dead**
		- John uses this spell because it was his only hope to survive. if He was not of space affinity, he would have died (unless Casil supported him from beginning without stopping and sparing any resources - which he did not).
		- **It is vary hard to cast spells inside of the body, since bodies are usually already evolved**
		- **ONLY REASON John could make Pocket Dimension inside of his body, was because he was unevolved and Human (humans have special constitution for mana)**
		- **By guiding his evolution with:**
			- physical exercises, 
			- constantly keeping Pocket Dimension active inside of his mana pool shell,
			- doing basic magic exercises (this is for senses, detection, feeling, mana control) John build optimal body for himself on his own (with no help from Casil)
	- **Space Veil** - this spell is made by John, with only resources from Casil's library
	- **Minor Teleport** - this spell is used as exercise and introduction to the **Teleport** spell (true spell had longer reach, faster casting time, but it was more complex and needed a lot more mana)
		- This spell was used in building Space Jump Box
	- **Space Time Box** - Artifact designed and built by John 
		- it was meant to be used on himself, but as he as was building it, it had higher and higher requirements for power source and less protection for the one who is using it, so he need to use it on the Casil's tower. he modified Space Veil combined with Pocket dimension to develop new spell that would cut space of around the tower (it could cut more, but it needs stronger power source and better materials to be embedded in)
