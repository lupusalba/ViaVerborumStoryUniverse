# 10) Story line #1 - The Void Walker
## Premise:
Special Forces officer gets stranded in alien world with magic and combine alien magic with humans thousands years of art of war and human creativity

# Story plot-line
After accident with spatial rift, officer John Silver awakes in the middle of small forest, close to the dirt road. He gets captured by traveling orc merchant, and gifted (with many other things) to the planet governor. governor did not know what to do with John, so he gifted him to his father, arch mage Casil, and sent John to Casil's magic tower.
- Casil is curious about john (since he is not native and he is getting light mana poisoning). John is wary of Casil but complies for now.
- John have language knowledge forced in his head by Casil casting 6th circle spell - Knowledge Imprint
- Casil start testing John and discover that he is not evolved by mana - which is impossible to be in inner universe. 
- John, analyzing his situation, understands that he is hopeless (no way home, sick from mana poisoning, captured by mage), and he acknowledge that he is already dead, so he can not die again. he accepts his situation, and let himself be free of everything (duty to family, duty to human race). He decides that it is better for him to accept this world as his new reality, and to make the best of it. 
	- **Note:** John is not depressed, or anxious. John is exited to be in new world and existence of magic.
- John is tested by Casil for various things
	- Some test are borderline torture, but Casil do not do any permanent damage
	- Some test John do not feel at all
	- Casil finds that John has great potential for magic (even not evolved yet), and even rare Space affinity - but he also finds that something is not right with Johns mana pool.
- John is getting interrogated by Casil (where is he from, how did he end up here, are there more beings like him, etc.) 
- After all tests, Casil decides that John can be a vary good research project and that it can bring him a lot of new insights in mana:
	- Casil can find how evolution by mana works
	- Casil can observe evolution and guide it
- John is gets role of servant and small storage is his bedroom.
- John is guided regularly by Casil until he learns mana absorption and form first mana circle
- As John absorb more mana, his mana poisoning gets more severe (nausea, lightheartedness, vomiting, disorientation, passing out).
	- John tries to reveres mana absorption technique - to disperse mana
	- John stops absorbing mana after forming first inner circle
	- john start to actively practice mana dispersion
- Casil notices what John is doing, and after more special test, he concludes that, since John did not complete his evolution by mana, even though he does have potential as mage and his mana pool is filled with small amount of mana, his mana pool shell is too weak - it can break with little more pressure. With mana poisoning, incomplete evolution and probable mana pool breaking, John has around 3 to 5 years to live. 
	- Casil is disappointed in John, but decides to use him as servant (to do manual labor) and to do more experiment on him.
	- John can access most parts of the tower
- Casil returns to his other research and experiments.
- John does not know how long he will able to postpone his death (with mana dispersion), or when Casil may decided to more harmful experiments on him
- John continuous practicing mana dispersion, and notices that:
	- by expelling mana from mana pool, he is speeding up his evolution
	- any harm or injury is healing much faster
	- pressure is much less on mana pool shell
	- he can practice mana dispersion while moving (when mage practice mana absorption and refainment, they usaulay sit down and meditate, vary few can move around. Beasts can move around and passivly absorb mana)
- John starts doing physical exercises at night, and combine them with mana dispersion -> effect of evolution is much bigger and training is more effective -> John is conditioning his body and evolving it.
- In free time (after all manual labor), john spends most of his time in the library, learning basic magic, basic magic theory, basic spells.
- John makes big advancements in his learning, and master basic mana theory
- John finds book on most basic magic exercises (moving mana in the body, pushing out mana from mana pool and moving that mana outside in different shapes, mana detection and sensitivity exercises. etc) - all exercises are universal for mages of any affinity. _most mages do not spend more than a day on this, since they think it is not effective and is outdated_ 
	- John add all exercises to his routine
	- John can practice all exercises since he does not need to gather mana in mana pool, but to disperse it outside
		- normal mage would need to get mana inside, and it would be too wasteful to just spend mana on some basic exercises with no clear or immediate benefit
- John continue to learn basic magic
- John learns first circle space spell Mini Gate (most basic space spell, meant as introduction to The Gate spell)
	- John add practice of this spell to his routine
- John spend more and more time in the library 
	- He perfected basic magic knowledge
	- He learned:
		- how to form and blueprints for inner magic circles from 1st to 3rd
		- mini gate and minor teleport (theory only)
	- He understands:
		- basic spells of other elements (for reference), but he can not cast any spell except those of space affinity
- Casil is stuck in his study for few months (he exited few times at the beginning), doing some research
- John is no longer suffering from mana poisoning
- John started to think of practical application of the Mini Gate spell:
	- opening one gate next to him and one next to the target, shooting at the target at point blank (rock, some weapon, knife)
	- opening vary small mini gate to disrupt magic spells, formations, ambient mana
	- getting things from far away (moving things from his hand to shelf and reversed for example)
- John adds visualized combat to his routine
	- based on all magic spells he understood (of other elements), magic theory and all resources, combined with his education in human territory and experience as solider, he visualizes magic combat - not just shooting spells at each other, but use of terrine, assassination, hiding, running away, ambush, guerrilla tactics
		- as John learns more and more (from all fields of magic and all resources), his imagination is increased and he can think about more complex fights - what to do, how to solve this problem, how to eliminate the target etc.
	- John applies thousands of years of humans art of war, combined with human creativity to magic theory and history apex magic civilization
- John notices that it is easier to learn and master spells after practicing exercises from exercise book
- John continues his routine and gets batter and batter in every field
	- he master mini gate (he can open gate far away, he can decide and adjust mini gate size, he can cast mini gate vary fast - like experienced mage)
- Casil leaves his study, and checkup on John
	- Casil is surprised about John state 
		- no more mana poisoning
		- barely first circle mana quantity in mana pool (negative surprise)
	- John hides his actual progress (all knowledge he mastered and learned)
- Casil returns to his study again for few months
- John starts to increase range of mini gate, and to try to open it outside of the tower
- John learns:
	- theory of all basic spells of first and second circle in Casil's library (but can not cast any)
	- theory on how to form and blueprint of inner magic circles from 4th to 6th from the library
- John find incomplete high level space spell Pocket Dimension in space theory book, fallen behind the shelf
	- John gets idea to make mini pocket dimension inside himself, but he is not disillusioned - he only aims to make Pocket Dimension of size 1:1, so he can use it as shell of mana pool.
		- If he masters it completely, he may be able to make much bigger and more stable space inside mana pool and much bigger storage
- John cut down time in the library and dedicate it to completing variation of Pocket Dimension spell
- John gets better and better with mini pocket dimension
- John succeeds in making mini pocket dimension inside mana pool (below mana pool shell)
	- he is vary excited, his attention wakens, and pocket dimension spell breaks (spells usually last short period of time, or while they are cast)
	- he damages his mana shell and his inner organs, nearly killing himself
	- he barely survives, and very slowly (over whole day) practice mana dispersion to heal himself as much as possible.
	- after he heals himself, he understands his mistake.
	- He do another pocket dimension, but this time he is calm (since he confirmed that it is possible)
	- he spends 3 days in meditation, keeping pocket dimension active.
	- after 3 days, he tries to move - vary slowly and little.
	- after 2 more days of light moving, he can move more and faster
	- after one more day he can move nearly normally.
	- pocket dimension is acting as mana shell and he is not under risk of dying from mana shell braking (but he will die if pocket dimension destabilizes and breaks)
- John stops everything and dedicate all his time to the library 
	- he can not practice anything since he need to keep pocket dimension active all the time
	- he can not absorb mana since he can not spare more attention to it
	- he can not disperse mana (and there is no need any more)
	- he can not sleep first few days (since he need to keep spell active)
	- after a week, he can keep spell active for dozen minutes in his sleep (_needs revision and improvement_)
	- John starts learning other fields of magic (he mastered only basic theory, and basic magic spells):
		- magic formations
		- artifact crafting
		- spells of second and third circle of other elements (for reference and inspiration)
		- he reads encyclopedia of magic resources, encyclopedia of magic races, encyclopedia of artifacts, history of planet, history of empire, history of inner universe, and few books on stories, miscellaneous information (architecture, agriculture, politics, war, etc.)
- after 3 weeks, John is completely used to keeping pocket dimension active and he can sleep longer
- After week 4, John starts to practice mana exercises again
- after week 5, John starts to cast another spell - the Mini Gate (with pocket dimension still active, so its technically high level skill - multi cast)
- after week 6, John tries to absorb mana
	- mana is absorbed with no problems, but he must meditate and move it in pocket dimension and mana pool (pocket dimension is blocking everything from going in or out, including mana)
	- John can store mana in mana pool with no problem
- after weak 7, John forms second inner magic circle
- John  spends 3 days to stabilizes and refine mana again in the pocket dimension (mana pool)
- John start to absorb and refine mana again and form 3rd inner circle (his mana control is far from his actual circle level - his practice of basic magic exercises got him to the level of experienced 5th circle mage - so he can form 3rd circle with no problem)
- John stabilize his 3rd circle, and refine mana again in his mana pool so it is purer and better
- John returns to his old routine (library, mana exercises, mini gate spell practice, mana dispersion, physical exercise)
	- since he needs to disperse mana for evolution now, he understands how wasteful that action is (since he is spending mana that he already refined).
	- he understands that he wont be able to advance in circle number of mana quantity if he continues to do it like that - he needs a way to increase absorption and refinement
	- John gets idea to open mini gate outside of the tower (since if he made large disturbance in mana inside tower, he will alert Casil), and absorb mana from outside
	- John start to absorb mana from outside, efficiency is better but still not good enough
	- John decides to open one more pair of gates (he barely succeeds but come close to dying since he nearly lost control of pocket dimension)
		- efficiency is now much better, he is adsorbing more then dispersing
- John continuous his routine (learn, train, evolve, practice)
- John figures out that if Casil found out his situation, he may change his attitude to him and he may be at risk of death or other miserable fate again - he needs to hide his ability
	- he looks for spells  and formations for hiding, gets inspiration, and modify hiding formation to be space affinity spell, and cast it over pocket dimension
	- John again stops his routine and dedicate all time to keeping spells pocket dimension and new spell Minor Veil (spell for hiding) active at the same time
	- 2 weeks later, John start to practice basic magic exercises. He needed more time to master new technique:
		- step 0: cast pocket dimension (already cast, and only kept active)
		- step 1: cast Minor Veil over mana pool  shell (Pocket dimension is cast inside mana pool's shell to decrease pressure on mana pool shell)
		- step 2: keep both spells active
		- note 1:  it is not true double casting - he cast one spell and keep it active (now already subconscious, and then cast another spell and keep it active)
		- note 2: he can stop the Minor Veil spell and start again - to use it only when he needs it
		- note 3: The Minor Veil is not perfect - if John is thoroughly checked, with focus on mana pool, something will be detected
- Before John perfected the Minor Veil, Casil left his study in a hurry, and checked John in passing (short check), John was nearly caught, but Minor Veil was success.
- Casil left tower in the hurry, John is left alone in the tower
- John continued his routine (exercises, learning, spell casting practice of the Mini Gate)
- ### this part may be changed
	-  2 days after Casil left, magic tower defenses had been activated - magic tower was under attack
	- **NOTE:** We may need to change cause of attack and cause of enemy arrival to be more plausible
	- arch mage Aegnor (early 7th circle, combat type), arch mage of magic tower, and enemy of Casil, member of rival noble family with ancient enmity, came under orders of Royal Magic Tower to personally bring a letter from Vice Tower Master to Casil.
	- Since Casil did not come out, Aegnor decided to do few probing strikes on the tower, Casil did not come still, Aegnor intensified strikes from probing to active attack, but Casil did not come still (nor did Casil used tower to fight back). Aegnor gambled that Casil is not in the tower or that he can not engage in fight, so he started to rain attack spell after spell, and to prepare tactical, forbidden war spell to damage the tower.
	- Since first spell, John got on high alert, but he did not know what he can do, or will tower defense hold
	- John tried to go in tower control room, but it was locked
	- John observed attack from the window, and tried to cast the Mini Gate spell outside of the tower to disrupt the attack. 
		- John started disrupting the enemy by making Mini Gate spell close to enemy magic circle of big war spell, and disrupting mana flow
		- John made another pair of Mini Gates, one behind the mage and one next to him and started throwing things at him
		- enemy was greatly surprised, lost control of war magic circle, and his spell collapsed, he started new one, while very angry
		- John succeeded in delaying the enemy a little for 2 hours until Casil came back
	- Casil came back and had argument with enemy mage after exchanging few attacks (since they can not kill each other - Casil can go in and use tower to fight or hide, and enemy can run away)
	- Enemy leaves, and Casil tries to go in the tower, but it is locked

### unfinished parts of story:
 - we have 2 options for story development after Casil leaves the tower:
	 - **Option A:**
		 - enemy attacks, John shows his tactical application of space magic and keep enemy distracted for short time until Casil returns
		 - John forces Casil to take him as a student and to not harm him (since John had revealed his hidden power)
		 - John and Casil make an oath
		 - Casil teach john for 3 years, Johns progression is too fast and his application of magic left deep impression on Casil (when he disrupted enemy mage).
			 - Casil is secretly afraid of him, and looks for a way to bypass the oath, and finds a way - send him to the Royal magic tower in exchange for resources to forcefully get to the 8th circle
			 - John is vary valuable - he is very talented and rare space affinity mage
			 - Casil arranges this, John finds about it when Casil leaves the tower,
			 - Casil returns with other mages from royal tower, but John already took over control of Casil's magic tower and kept them out
			 - They have confrontation, John teleport whole tower randomly, and appear in wilderness 
				 - John can do teleport by using either artifact he made (simple teleportation spell powered by lay lines - main power source of the tower),
					 - John started working on that artifact as idea to go home or run away, artifact is incomplete and imperfect (but it was made with vary high quality materials and with one and vary simple function), so teleportation is random but possible (with risks)
					 - whole tower is teleported (with little structural damage)
				 - or tower had that function already
		- end of the story (cliffhanger)
	- **Option B:**
		- we do time skip of 5 years - in that time skip:
			- Casil did his research and forgot about John **(the reason why Casil ignored John will need improvement)**
			- John perfected the Minor Veil spell and improved Pocket Dimension spell
				- Minor Veil can hide his mana pressure from everyone of 7th and lower circles (unless deep scan)
				- Pocket Dimension has proportion 1:10 (it is 10 times bigger inside - and it is far bigger then any other member of magic empire), stability is vary good
			- John reached 5th inner circle and refined all mana again
				- he is ready to form 6th circle
			- John read everything from library
			- John's mental combat visualization is on vary high level - but nothing is yet tested, practical test is needed.
			- John can deploy dozen of Mini Gates outside of the tower and absorb mana from the outside (that is why Casil did not notice disturbance in mana inside tower, or lower density), so that he can grow in secret
			- Johns artifact crafting is firmly in 5th level
				- he is making space focused artifacts of all kinds (utility and combat):
					- his main project is artifact for long distance teleportation - Space Jump Box - but it is not perfect nor finished. and it needs a lot of power for teleportation (like lay lines)
			- Johns magic formations are in 5th level as well (and utilized in artifact refining)
		- John plans to steal magic tower and escape
			- When Casil leaves the tower, John connect his Space Jump Box to the towers power sources, and teleports away:
				- to another planet or some wilderness of Casil's planet
		- end of the story (cliffhanger)
## Backstory of Humans
Year is 2850. Humans conquered dozens of dead planets, and terraformed them. Human population is nearly half trillion.
In year 2152, humans first detected anomaly on one side of the universe - border from edge to edge of known universe on that side. Humans could not see what is inside.
From year 2204 till now, human have sent many probes, but nothing could pass through the asteroid belt.
Humans started using asteroid belt and fast moving asteroid for development:
- fast moving asteroids were used as practice targets for new weapons
- navigation, targeting and ai systems were trained on movements of asteroids.
- every new weapon was shot at least once at the asteroid belt
Only in year 2583 did humans succeed in making a hole - using power of star and directing its energy as laser to cut a pathway through which they sent probe - automated spaceship for 10 year long mission.Success was achieved  in Gemini Domain, under 4 star general Silver. After 10 years, humans activated Star Canon again, to open the path for the probe to return. Probe returned, but results were confusing - there was nothing - big expanse of just nothing - no celestial bodies, no light, no asteroid or debris, only emptiness. Humans continued to use asteroid belt as training dummy, and from time to time, they would send more and more probes through the barrier. over time, Star Canon was optimized and improved, it needed less time to charge, it shoot more concentrated beam, it needed less time between each shoot. After more then 100 years, Star Canon could shoot once per month and humans send more probes in. After all this time, humans made a chain of miniature space stations to try and find the end of empty space. One of biggest challenges was random appearance of spatial rifts - anomalies that tore through everything and destroyed space stations from time to time. Humans needed to send new space stations regularly to keep chain active. In year 2743, the end was found - another asteroid belt. Greatest minds of human race were gathered and tasked with finding a way to send probes over border. It was decided to use Star Canon, and to fire array of beams on the same spot on the other side - there was no other way. Humans started building array of Star Canons around the closest star. After 122 years from first shot, with a lot of resources of all humanity, project was finished, and 120 Star Canons were connected. This array of Star Canons, called Path Maker, could keep beam continuous for  3 days, and its beam was at 89% of speed of light. Plan was to have a automated space ship with deep space probes and mapping equipment - pinnacle of human technology, go in when beam opens the  way. Space ship was already sent, and waiting in position close to the planed hole. Plan was a success - beam reached the other side and made a path for the spaceship. Spaceship was gone for 6 moths. After 6 months, the hole was opened and spaceship returned. Most of retrieved data was corrupted and malfunctioning, but what was confirmed was that there are celestial bodies and marks of space fearing civilization. Human Earth council started planning for expedition - infiltration. Team was assembled, best operatives of human race. they were sent with fastest, stealthiest and most durable space ship. but in the middle of the travel through the boundary, vary large spatial rift appeared before the space ship, and destroyed it. mission was marked as failed. new missions with humans were postponed. 
Biggest benefit of boundary exploration was development of star canon and star canon array. humans decided to improve their technology.

# FIXES FOR THE PROBLEMS IN THE STORY
fixes:

# 1) Universe compliance check
###  evolution timeline problem:
- John did not evolve. i did not specify it, but reason why he used pocket dimension is to bypass evolution requirement. 
- John evolved to 0.7 at the end of first story (with every step of evolution, he suffered less and less from mana poisoning, at 0.7 of evolution, he is no longer having obvious and big problems).
	- his life is no longer in danger
 - John is guiding his evolution in optimal direction for himself (by doing physical exercises and magic training) and progressing at controlled peace.
 - Biggest exposure to mana is inside body (mana pool), and that is quarantined by Pocket Dimension
 - from arrival to the tower, John spent more then 5 years (6 or 7) in the tower, till the end of story (time-skip is 5 years, and first 1 or 2 are introduction to routine and progress).

### Casil’s library contains restricted material problem:
- Casil is still part of the Royal magic tower technicality, and he is descendant of ancient noble family
- Casil is respected mage scholar who is still working with the tower. most of his research is submitted to the tower, and tower partly funds him
- Restrictions for knowledge are made for middle class and lower class, all great nobles have blueprints for 7th circle and 8th.
	- If mage is talented and loyal, he will get access to restricted blueprints
### The tower attack motivation is currently thin - problem:
- i need ideas for this one

### “Casil forgot about John” (Option B) is not believable as written problem:
we will go with option A, but take good parts of option B




# 2) The cleanest plot direction
- we will flow you suggestion

# 3) Fix the “tower attack” so it’s inevitable, plausible, and sharper
- **I DO NOT LIKE ANY OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS FOR THIS**
- **We will change identity of the attacker** - attacker will be part of terrorist/rebel group, and he wont be alone - two 7th circle mages will start attack on tower with group of 6th and 5th mages with a goal of stealing Casil's tower and all resources and killing Casil (famous and respected mage scholar of the Royal magic tower and descendant of ancient mage family)
- The reason Casil left in the hurry is because smaller part of group (1 7th circle mage and group of 6th and 5th circle mage attacked his family). His son (current patriarch of that branch family) sent him SOS and call for help
- John will kill (snipe, ambush) a few 5th circle mages and wound 6th circle mage
	- John will use throwing knives and similar "mortal" weapons (for mages this weapons are less detectable - since they are not used in the fights with mages)
	- John will disrupt combined attack of 7th circle mage and group of 6th circle mages (7th circle mage constructed the war spell and other mages added their mana, so they can pull more ambient mana to cast peak seventh circle war spell)
- Casil will be shocked by John's practical ability (since John will be at 3rd circle at that point)

### 4) Give John’s space magic hard rules (prevents Mary Sue vibes)
- John only have few spells:
	- **Mini Gate** - this spell was used as exercises by space mages, it was not used in a way that John uses it.
		- This spell, in its original form, requires of caster to have clear line of sight for second gate, and first gate must be close to the caster.
		- With practice, caster can change size of the gate, and increase the distance between two gates
		- This spell can not be cast inside barriers, formations or anything that separates one space from another (unless the difference between caster and other space is big).
			- If it is deployed in different space, then it increase mana consumption.
			- **Note**:** Casil's tower does not hinder deployment of spell from inside to outside. If John tried to cast mini gate from outside of the tower to inside, he would fail every time.
		- This spell uses little less mana then true Gate spell (it is energy inefficient)
		- When caster is distracted, it will crumble and fail
		- As John practice it more and more, added with it constant practice of basic mana exercise, John's sensitivity is increased.
			- When John learn Minor Teleport, he started to combine it with the Mini Gate (to make new spell) and after 3 years, when he reached 4th circle, he succeeded in deploying Mini gate outside of his view  - but in the spot he felt. with more practice, he could position it more and more precisely.
		- The Mini Gate at the beginning and at the end, are not the same spell - John completely modified it.
		- When John was fighting against attackers, he had clear line of sight through one way windows (he could see outside, they could not see him)
	- **Pocket Dimension** - this spell was incomplete (it is 6th circle spell), John modified it to be more a container for mana, with proportion of size outside and inside 1:1 (true spell has proportion of 1:100, example: box 1x1x1m outside, but space inside is 100x100x100m)
		- This spell is used as storage spell, to make moving things easier
		- this spell is commonly embedded on rings, bracelets and pouches (things easy to carry) by formation masters and artifact crafters.
		- **no one used this spell inside of their body - one mistake and they are dead**
		- John uses this spell because it was his only hope to survive. if He was not of space affinity, he would have died (unless Casil supported him from beginning without stopping and sparing any resources - which he did not).
		- **It is vary hard to cast spells inside of the body, since bodies are usually already evolved**
		- **ONLY REASON John could make Pocket Dimension inside of his body, was because he was unevolved and Human (humans have special constitution for mana)**
		- **By guiding his evolution with:**
			- physical exercises, 
			- constantly keeping Pocket Dimension active inside of his mana pool shell,
			- doing basic magic exercises (this is for senses, detection, feeling, mana control) John build optimal body for himself on his own (with no help from Casil)
	- **Space Veil** - this spell is made by John, with only resources from Casil's library
	- **Minor Teleport** - this spell is used as exercise and introduction to the **Teleport** spell (true spell had longer reach, faster casting time, but it was more complex and needed a lot more mana)
		- This spell was used in building Space Jump Box
	- **Space Time Box** - Artifact designed and built by John 
		- it was meant to be used on himself, but as he as was building it, it had higher and higher requirements for power source and less protection for the one who is using it, so he need to use it on the Casil's tower. he modified Space Veil combined with Pocket dimension to develop new spell that would cut space of around the tower (it could cut more, but it needs stronger power source and better materials to be embedded in)
