# The Last Ride

---

The rain on the Razor's Edge didn't wash things clean; it just turned the dust of the gorge into a slick, grey paste that smelled of iron and old graves.

Korgan Ironbeard leaned against a jagged outcrop of slate, pressing a gauntleted hand to the gash on his forehead. He was the last. The rest of the patrol lay broken further down the trail, and below them, the valley floor was a river of fire. The Black-Tusk Orc Clan was marching. Thousands of torches flickered in the mist, a serpentine line of death winding its way up toward the pass.

Their war drums echoed up from the valley—a rhythmic, bone-deep thumping that synced with the pounding in his own skull.

"So be it," Korgan grunted, spitting a mouthful of blood into the mud. "If the ancestors want company, I'll send them a legion."

He reached into his belt pouch and withdrew a twisted, blackened object. It looked like a desiccated root, ancient and hard as stone. Korgan brought it to his cracked lips and blew a sharp, low whistle.

For a moment, only rain and distant drums. Then the earth trembled.

From the black mouth of a cave twenty paces up the slope, a shadow detached itself from the darkness. It moved with a terrifying, jerky gait, its head bobbing forward with each step like a serpent striking the air. Even from this distance, Korgan could smell it—musk and old straw, mixed with something wild.

Click. Scrape. Click.

The sound of its claws on stone echoed off the canyon walls. As it stepped into the moonlight, the creature let out a low, vibrating thrum—a sound that seemed to come from the tectonic plates beneath the mountain. The vibration traveled through the ground and into Korgan's boots.

It was massive, broad-chested and heavy, with a silhouette that blocked out the stars.

Korgan limped forward, reaching out to touch the creature's flank. The beast's coat was a suit of bristling, iridescent armor that drank the light, shifting from black to bronze in the gloom. At its throat hung a fleshy, blood-red war-mask, loose skin that shook with the creature's agitation.

"Easy, old friend," Korgan murmured, feeling the immense heat radiating through the creature's dense, quill-like plating. "Tonight, we ride to the halls of our ancestors. Tonight, we make them sing our names."

The beast shifted its weight, its armored shanks digging into the mud. It turned its head, revealing a face that was nothing but bone and malice—a wedge-shaped skull ending in a hooked ivory pike. Its eyes, small beads of obsidian, fixed on the torches below with unblinking hate.

Korgan hauled himself into the worn leather saddle strapped to the creature's broad back. His wounded leg screamed in protest, but he ignored it. He gripped the worn reins—leather straps looped around the base of the beast's neck—and felt the creature's muscles coiling beneath him.

The beast was eager. It bobbed its head, shifting from foot to foot, the thrumming in its chest growing louder. Below, the Orcs were already halfway up the pass. Their standards were visible now, their voices clear over the rain.

One last ride.

He leaned forward, whispering into the tuft of dark feathers hiding the creature's ear. "Ride, old friend. Ride for ruin and glory."

The beast exploded into motion.

They didn't charge. They bounded.

His mount moved nothing like a horse. It launched itself down the slope in great, lurching leaps—a gait that was all jerking momentum and barely-controlled violence. Korgan's bones rattled with each impact. Wind screamed through the creature's quill-armor. He could feel the heat radiating from its body, the muscles coiling and releasing beneath the saddle, the sharp bursts of breath that came in rhythm with his own hammering heart.

They hit the Orc vanguard like a boulder dropped from the heavens.

The impact was wet and crunching. Korgan's axe caught the first Orc in the neck, shearing through vertebrae in a spray of black ichor. The body was still falling when his mount tore into the second rank.

The beast was the true weapon. It did not trample; it struck with the precision of a duelist. Its armored shanks lashed out in a blur—the wicked, curved spurs hooking into a shield, punching through the wood, and dragging the Orc off his feet. Before the creature even landed, it drove its wedge-shaped head forward like a battering ram. The ivory pike caught an Orc wearing chain mail directly in the sternum. Korgan heard ribs crack.

An Orc with a spear tried to thrust upward at the beast's exposed belly. The point skittered off the quill-armor with a shriek of metal on keratin. The beast's head snapped sideways. Its pike caught the Orc under the jaw and sent him spinning into the darkness, screaming.

"Hold the line!" an Orc captain roared, raising a notched sword.

The beast pivoted—a sharp, jerking motion—and slammed its broad chest into the captain. The impact lifted the Orc off his feet and hurled him over the edge of the pass. His scream faded into the abyss below.

"What is that thing?!" a voice shrieked from the rear ranks.

"It moves like a demon!"

"Those sounds! By the gods, what are those sounds?!"

Korgan's arm was already burning, his axe slick with blood, but he didn't slow. He couldn't. The beast fought with tireless, mechanical brutality, and he matched its rhythm.

The thrumming from the beast's chest grew louder, resonating through the saddle and into Korgan's ribs. It was a guttural vibration that rattled teeth and made the torches flicker. The sound had weight—physical, oppressive, prehistoric. Even the Orcs felt it. Some pressed hands to their chests, faces twisted in confusion.

Korgan laughed, a manic sound lost in the chaos. He swung his axe left and right, hewing limbs, while beneath him his companion fought with a frenzy that defied logic. Blood slicked its iridescent coat. The thing showed no sign of fatigue. If anything, the carnage seemed to feed it. A gurgle of wet rage rose from its chest—stones grinding in a flooded throat—and it surged deeper into the horde.

Thirty dead. Maybe forty. The narrow pass had become a butcher's block, slick with rain and blood.

But numbers always tell in the end. The Orcs pulled back, forming a wary ring around the dwarf and his monster. Twenty paces of empty ground. Twenty paces of silence broken only by labored breathing and the drum of rain on armor.

Korgan's chest heaved. Blood ran from a dozen minor cuts, mixing with the rain. Beneath him, the beast stood with its legs planted wide, head jerking side to side, eyes glittering with challenge. Daring anyone to approach.

No one did.

Then, from deep within the Orc ranks, came the sound of heavy iron boots on stone. The sound of something inevitable.

The ranks parted.

Warlord Grakka the Undying pushed to the front. He was a mountain of muscle wrapped in blackened plate, wielding a hammer the size of an anvil. He stepped into the circle of light cast by the torches and stopped.

For a long moment, there was only the sound of rain drumming on metal.

Grakka squinted through the gloom. He looked at Korgan. Then he looked at the beast. He stared at the iridescent sheen of its dark coat, the blood-red cowl of skin at its throat, and the massive, scaled feet. His eyes tracked from the creature's wobbling neck-skin to its stick-thin shanks to the way it held its head cocked at an odd angle.

The Warlord's expression shifted from bloodlust to something else—genuine, baffled confusion. He lowered his hammer slightly.

"You..." Grakka's voice was a gravelly rumble. "What manner of scrawny, worm-necked thing is that?"

Korgan stiffened, gripping his axe tighter. The insult to his companion cut deeper than any blade.

"This is no mere beast!" Korgan roared, his voice echoing off the canyon walls. "This is death given form! This is the companion of my soul! He will grind your bones to dust!"

Grakka blinked, looking at his lieutenants, then back at Korgan. He pointed a thick green finger at the mount, his face twisted in genuine confusion.

"No, I do not mock the small one," Grakka said slowly. "But that creature... it should be in a pen, not on a battlefield. Why does it bob its head like a damned—"

"You dare?" Korgan screamed, his face flushing purple. "You dare insult the bearer of my fate?!"

A ripple of nervous, uncertain laughter moved through the Orc ranks.

He kicked the beast's flanks. "Kill him!"

The beast launched itself at the Warlord. But Grakka was ready. He didn't flinch. He planted his feet and swung the massive iron hammer in a devastating, rising arc intended to shatter the creature's chest.

The beast did not rear. It didn't turn or dodge.

Instead, great dark sails unfurled from its sides—stiff pennants of flesh and quill that beat the air with the sound of canvas snapping in a gale. It was a clumsy, desperate motion, a heave of muscle that lifted the creature just feet off the ground.

The hammer whooshed underneath them, missing the beast's shanks by inches.

But Grakka twisted his grip and brought the hammer back in a savage backswing. The iron head clipped the creature's rear—not the body, but the long, dark banner that trailed behind it.

Snap. Crunch.

Several long, majestic quills spiraled away into the darkness.

The creature landed heavily in the mud. It went perfectly still. The thrumming stopped. The silence that fell over the pass was absolute.

Then, slowly, it turned its head.

The dark pennant behind Korgan suddenly rose. It spread, unfurling into a massive, fan-shaped wall of blades. Each quill caught the torchlight, creating a halo of iridescent bronze, copper, and green that seemed to burn in the night. The beast's body puffed up, the feathers standing on end until the creature seemed to triple in bulk, becoming a sphere of armored rage.

The blood-red war-mask at its throat darkened, shifting instantly to a vibrant, angry blue that pulsed with every heartbeat.

The creature's chest swelled, quills bristling outward until it doubled in size. It tilted its head back, exposing the vibrant blue war-mask at its throat, and from somewhere deep in its belly came a sound that would haunt the nightmares of the Black-Tusk Clan for the rest of their days.

"GLUG-GLUG-GLUG-GOBBLE!"

The sound was enormous. It echoed off the canyon walls, doubled back on itself, seemed to shake loose stones from the cliffs above. Korgan felt it vibrate through the saddle, through his armor, through his teeth.

Silence.

Warlord Grakka stood perfectly still. His eyes moved from the fanned tail to the blue wattle to the strutting feet. His hammer slowly lowered.

"No," Grakka whispered.

The hammer slipped from his fingers and hit the stone with a dull clang.

"That's a turkey," Grakka said, his voice stripped of all authority. He looked at his lieutenants. Then back at the creature. "That's a giant _turkey_."

An Orc near the back started to laugh—a high, hysterical sound.

"The dwarf," Grakka said slowly, "rides a _turkey_ into battle."

"TREMBLE BEFORE—" Korgan began.

But the beast—now unmistakably identifiable as a massive, aggressive turkey—was done with strategy. It was offended.

With a shriek of prehistoric fury, the giant turkey charged. t didn't bound this time; it waddled with lethal intent, a ball of feathers and rage moving at terrifying speed. Grakka tried to raise his hammer, but the turkey was inside his guard instantly.

The Warlord shrieked as the ivory pike hammered his breastplate—clang-clang-clang—like a mad blacksmith. Spurs raked his kneecaps. Wings battered his helmet. And that sound—that ungodly gobbling—filled his ears, his skull, his entire world.

GLUG-GLUG-GLUG!

"GET IT OFF!" Grakka screamed, arms flailing. "I'M BEING DEFEATED BY A _BIRD!_"

The Warlord tripped over a corpse and fell backward into the mud with a tremendous clang. The turkey hopped onto the Warlord's chest, puffing his chest out and rattling his quills, asserting total dominance.

For a moment, the Orc army stood frozen in collective disbelief.

Then someone in the back ranks laughed—a high, hysterical sound.

"The Warlord's been beaten by a _chicken!_" an Orc shouted.

"That's a turkey, you moron!"

"WHO CARES? IT'S POULTRY!"

"The Clucking Doom!" another voice wailed. "It's the Clucking Doom!"

The name caught like fire in dry brush. Within seconds, hundreds of Orcs were screaming it, their voices rising in pitch with each repetition. They had faced dragons and demons. They had stormed castle walls under boiling oil. But this—watching Grakka the Undying pinned in the mud by an enormous, gobbling turkey—was beyond their comprehension.

They broke. They ran. They fled down the mountain, abandoning weapons and torches, screaming about curses and dark magic and the blue-faced horror that strutted like vengeance itself.

In minutes, the pass was silent, save for the rain.

Korgan sat in the saddle, breathing heavily, adrenaline slowly fading. He looked around at the fleeing army, then down at his mount. The turkey hopped off the groaning Warlord and strutted in a tight circle, his tail fan still proudly displayed, shaking the rain from his feathers.

Korgan slowly dismounted. His legs nearly buckled, but he caught himself against the beast's flank. He looked at his companion—really looked at him for the first time in the light—seeing the wobbling snood, the round, dopey eyes, the absurd magnificence of him.

A sound escaped Korgan's throat. Not quite a laugh. Not quite a sob.

"Glorious," he whispered.

He reached into his belt pouch and pulled out the twisted root—no, not a root, just a dried cob of corn. He cracked it, revealing rows of yellow, dried kernels. He held his palm out flat.

Behind him, Warlord Grakka struggled to his knees, mud-caked and wheezing. He watched in disbelief as the "engine of death" lowered its beak and gently pecked corn from the dwarf's palm, making soft, contented purring sounds.

For a long moment, the only sounds were the fading rain and the soft tok-tok-tok of beak on gauntlet.

Then Grakka began to laugh. It started as a wheeze, then grew into a full-throated, broken sound that echoed off the canyon walls—the laugh of a man whose understanding of the world had just been shattered by poultry.

Korgan didn't turn around. He just kept feeding Drumstick, one kernel at a time, while the rain finally stopped and the first light of dawn touched the peaks above.

Below, an army retreated in disgrace, already composing songs about the Clucking Doom and the dwarf who rode it into legend.
